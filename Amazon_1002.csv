"['Catherine Clifford', 'Photo Courtesy Blue Origin']",2018-05-14 00:00:00,"Worth almost $133 billion, Jeff Bezos is currently the richest person in the world, according to Forbes.  As the boss of both the e-commerce behemoth Amazon and the aerospace company Blue Origin, Bezos is a tech titan whose businesses will very likely shape the future.  Despite relying on technology to build his fortune online, Bezos says he learned a key lesson about success at an early age in a much more down-to-earth setting: working with his grandfather on his grandparents' South Texas ranch.  What did it teach him? ""Being resourceful. If there's a problem, there's a solution,"" says Bezos, in an interview with Axel Springer CEO Mathias D√∂pfner, published by Business Insider at the end of April.  Bezos says his grandfather was ""full of wisdom"" and resourceful enough to do much of the work on the ranch by himself.  ""He was super important for me,"" Bezos says of his grandfather.  ""One of the things that's so interesting about that lifestyle and about my grandfather is he did everything himself. You know, he didn't call a vet if one of the animals was sick; he figured out what to do himself,"" says Bezos.  ""And of course as you get into the business world and anything you do on a team, you very quickly realize that it's not just about your own resourcefulness and that it's about team resourcefulness,"" he says.  Bezos, 54, was born in 1964 when his mom was 17.  ""I can assure you that being a pregnant teenager in high school was not cool in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at that time,"" says Bezos. ""And so it was very difficult for her.""  To help out his young parents, Bezos' grandparents took care of Bezos in South Texas every summer. As a kid, Bezos would help his grandfather out on their ranch.  ""I was so young, and it was useful. I was a handful, I'm sure. Anyway, he created the illusion for me when I was 4 years old that I was helping him on the ranch. Which, of course, cannot have been true. But I believed it. And by the time I was 16, of course, I was actually helping on the ranch. I could fix prolapsed cattle; we did all our own veterinary work. Some of the cattle even survived,"" says Bezos. ""And we fixed windmills, and laid water pipelines, and built fences, and barns, and fixed the bulldozer.""",What Jeff Bezos learned about how to be successful working on his grandfather‚Äôs ranch as a kid
['Mark Kaufman'],2018-05-12 00:00:00,"Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who is keen on calculations, has put Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' wealth into a space-themed perspective for us.  In the last year, Bezos became $40 billion richer, ballooning his wealth to over $130 billion. If this were put into dollar bills, each 6.14 inches long, Tyson calculates that the chain of greenbacks would ""circle Earth 200 times then reach the Moon & back 15 times then, with what‚Äôs left over, circle Earth another 8 times.""  SEE ALSO: Learn how to make serious money on Amazon  Not that anybody asked, but @JeffBezos' 130-Billion dollars, laid end-to-end, can circle Earth 200 times then reach the Moon & back 15 times then, with what‚Äôs left over, circle Earth another 8 times. ‚Äî Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) May 12, 2018  For a deeper perspective ‚Äî not that you asked ‚Äî the moon's average distance from Earth is about 238,000 miles, and the Earth's circumference is about 24,900 miles.  Bezos' wealth, of course, is driven by Amazon's success. And a foundational component of Amazon's success is an ""obsession"" with giving the customer what they want, as Bezos said in a 2016 letter to shareholders.  ""Even when they don‚Äôt yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf,"" he said. ""No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it, and I could give you many such examples.""  Now, Amazon is backed by so much wealth, it can innovate in wild, futuristic ways, and simply absorb the costs or potential failures at no threat to the company's sustainability. Take, for instance, the development of Amazon's autonomous Prime Air delivery drones.  ""One day, seeing Prime Air vehicles will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road,"" Amazon maintains.  Bezos' wealth, backed by Amazon stock, will almost certainly continue to trend up. For now, people are coming to terms with Tyson's current analysis of the Amazon founder's bank account.

At the 2017 Summit LA conference, Bezos recalled that, when he told his boss about his Internet bookstore idea, his boss said, ""I think this is a good idea, but I think this would be an even better idea for somebody that didn't already have a good job.""  That's when Bezos considered what his 80-year-old self would say if he did or didn't seize this opportunity.  ""In most cases, our biggest regrets turn out to be acts of omission.

['Kari Paul'],,"Jeff Bezos has so much money he doesn‚Äôt‚Äô know what to do with it‚Äîand he didn‚Äôt get there by separating his work and home life.  There does not necessarily need to be a strict line between work life and home life in order to be successful, the Amazon AMZN, +0.30% founder and chief executive officer said at a recent event hosted by publisher Axel Springer. He said home life and work life are, in fact, linked.  ‚ÄúThis work-life harmony thing is what I try to teach young employees and actually senior executives at Amazon too. But especially the people coming in,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI get asked about work-life balance all the time. And my view is, that‚Äôs a debilitating phrase because it implies there‚Äôs a strict trade-off.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAnd the reality is, if I am happy at home, I come into the office with tremendous energy,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd if I am happy at work, I come home with tremendous energy. It actually is a circle; it‚Äôs not a balance. And I think that is worth everybody paying attention to it.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou never want to be that guy‚Äîand we all have a coworker who‚Äôs that person‚Äîwho as soon as they come into a meeting they drain all the energy out of the room,‚Äù Bezos added, according to this transcript. ‚ÄúYou can just feel the energy go whoosh! You don‚Äôt want to be that guy.‚Äù  Such work-life harmony does not extend to the company‚Äôs warehouse employees, labor advocates claim. A U.K. investigator said in April many employees were forced to relieve themselves in bottles during 10-hour shifts, because they‚Äôre afraid of being disciplined for taking bathroom breaks. A spokeswoman from Amazon told MarketWatch it ensures all of its associates have ‚Äúeasy access to toilet facilities‚Äù and that toilet breaks are not monitored.  ‚ÄúAmazon provides a safe and positive workplace for thousands of people with competitive pay and benefits from day one,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are committed to treating every one of our associates with dignity and respect. We don‚Äôt recognize these allegations as an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings.‚Äù  Bezos has previously responded to criticisms of Amazon‚Äôs reported grueling corporate work culture‚Äîfrom warehouse workers to white-collar workers‚Äîsaying such reports are ‚Äúisolated anecdotes.‚Äù  He saw his personal wealth grow by $17.4 billion in January, and his net worth is now estimated to be more than $120 billion. The typical Amazon worker made less than $30,000 in 2017. (Amazon said that figure takes into account its global workforce of 560,000 people at all levels and said the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in its fulfillment centers, including cash, stock, and incentive bonuses, is over $15 per hour before overtime.)  ‚ÄúWe also offer employees a lot of flexibility, from part-time to seasonal to full-time. And we employ people in more than 50 countries ‚Äî from the U.S. to Poland to India,‚Äù an Amazon spokesman told MarketWatch in April. ‚ÄúOur median pay is across that entire range of our workforce.‚Äù  Americans struggle to find happiness at work  Americans, meanwhile, struggle to find happiness at work. More than half of U.S. employees were not engaged at work between 2010 and 2012 according to Gallup‚Äôs recent State of the American Workplace report, which collected data from more than 195,000 employees.

[],,"In a recent in-depth interview, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said that Amazon and his other businesses aren't nearly as important as Blue Origin.  Blue Origin builds, tests, and launches reusable rockets and spaceships in the desert of west Texas.  Bezos said he wants Blue Origin to help move all heavy industry into space and transform Earth into a residential and ""very beautiful planet.""    Jeff Bezos, the richest human on Earth, says Amazon and other lucrative ventures will never be as important to him as Blue Origin, his secretive aerospace startup in the Texas desert.  Bezos made the comments during a wide-ranging interview with Mathias D√∂pfner, the CEO of Axel Springer (Business Insider's parent company) on April 24 in Berlin.  His remarks came just days before Blue Origin successfully launched and landed its reusable New Shepard rocket for the eighth time.  On Sunday, the liquid-fueled rocket shot a capsule designed for space tourists into a high arc more than 66 miles above Earth - beyond the edge of space, though not into orbit.  No people rode in the New Shepard capsule in the test, but a dummy called ""Mannequin Skywalker"" was inside, recording data about the flight from a cushy, leather-lined seat.  Beyond opening doors for space tourism, Bezos is spending billions to design, build, and launch a massive, fully reusable orbital rocket called New Glenn. The behemoth is designed to compete with SpaceX and its launch systems starting around 2020.  ""This is super important to me, and I believe on the longest timeframe - and really here I'm thinking of a timeframe of a couple of hundred years, so over millions of decades - I believe and I get increasing conviction with every passing year, that Blue Origin, the space company, is the most important work that I'm doing,"" Bezos told D√∂pfner.  Bezos' Blue Origin dreams  Blue Origin is the rocket company that Bezos always dreamed about creating.  That dream was seeded on his grandparents' large ranch in South Texas. Growing up, Bezos learned to work with, repair, and appreciate machinery, and also frequently visited the county library, where he filled up on science fiction novels about space travel.  These and other formative experiences fueled his passion for spaceflight, eventually leading Bezos to secretly found Blue Origin in 2000, after he'd become a billionaire through Amazon. The goal: help make travel to space cheap, routine, and frequent.  Blue Origin's headquarters are in Seattle, but Bezos needed a remote place to test and launch rockets.  So after some perilous searching, he spent some of his newfound riches on a 30,000-acre ranch outside of Van Horn, Texas in 2004. Bezos eventually purchased more than 330,000 acres in the region - more than half the landmass of Rhode Island - according to the book ""The Space Barons"" by Christian Davenport.  Blue Origin has been very secretive for most of its existence. Only recently, after earning millions of dollars in contracts for NASA, has Bezos opened up about what the company is doing.  What Blue Origin is working on  One of Blue Origin's biggest projects - quite literally - is the New Glenn rocket: a reusable launch system that might help reduce the high cost of access to space.  Blue Origin has two designs in the works, according to a September 2016 announcement. The earliest version is a 270-foot tall, two-stage rocket. A more powerful 313-foot-tall, three-stage rocket will come later.  The smaller rocket will send satellites and other payloads into orbit. The larger launcher could eventually help Bezos set up a commercial base on the moon or even Mars.  Bezos says the first New Glenn rocket should debut in 2020, and Blue Origin has built a 750,000-square-foot hangar in Cape Canaveral, Florida, to power that work. (Blue Origin has thus far declined Business Insider's requests to see inside the facility.)  It's not yet clear how much a New Glenn launch will cost, though the booster will take off and re-land like SpaceX's, allowing it to get reused for future launches. That would save Blue Origin tens of millions of dollars in the process, perhaps reducing rocket-launch costs more than 10-fold in the future.  Both systems will compete with SpaceX's Falcon Heavy and Big Falcon Rocket systems. As of March 2017, Blue Origin had at least one customer signed up to launch a payload on New Glenn.  What Bezos said about Blue Origin's ultimate future  You can read the full transcript of Bezos's conversation with Axel Springer here, but here's what Bezos said about his long-term vision for Blue Origin:  D√∂pfner: So you'd say retail, e-commerce, publishing - that's all less relevant than the space project?  Yes, and I'll tell you why. First of all, of course, I'm interested in space, because I'm passionate about it and I've been studying it and thinking about it since I was a 5-year-old boy. But that is not why I'm pursuing this work. I'm pursuing this work because I believe if we don't, we will eventually end up with a civilization of stasis, which I find very demoralizing. I don't want my great-grandchildren's great-grandchildren to live in a civilization of stasis.  We all enjoy a dynamic civilization of growth and change. Let's think about what powers that. We are not really energy-constrained. Let me give you just a couple of numbers. If you take your body, your metabolic rate as a human - as just an animal, you eat food, that's your metabolism - you burn about a 100 watts. Your power, your body, is the same as a 100-watt lightbulb. We're incredibly efficient. Your brain is about 60 Watts of that. Amazing.  But if you extrapolate in developed countries, where we use a lot of energy, on average in developed countries, our civilizational metabolic rate is 11,000 Watts. So, in a natural state, where we're animals, we're only using a 100 Watts. In our actual developed-world state, we're using 11,000 Watts, and it's growing. For a century or more, it's been compounding at a few percent a year - our energy usage as a civilization.  Now if you take baseline energy usage, globally across the whole world, and compound it at just a few percent a year for just a few hundred years, you have to cover the entire surface of the Earth in solar cells. That's the real energy crisis. And it's happening soon. And by soon, I mean within just a few 100 years. So we don't actually have that much time.  So what can you do?  Well, you can have a life of stasis, where you cap how much energy we get to use. You have to work only on efficiency. By the way, we've always been working on energy efficiency, and still we grow our energy usage. It's not like we have been squandering energy. We have been getting better at using it with every passing decade, and still we grow it. So, stasis would be very bad I think.  Now take the alternative scenario, where you move out into the Solar System. The Solar System can easily support a trillion humans. And if we had a trillion humans, we would have a thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts and unlimited - for all practical purposes - resources and solar power and so on. That's the world that I want my great-grandchildren's great-grandchildren to live in.  And by the way, I believe that - in that timeframe - we will move all heavy industry off of Earth, and Earth will be zoned residential and light industry. It will basically be a very beautiful planet. We have sent robotic probes to every planet in this solar system now and believe me this is the best one.  But Jeff, when can I buy the first ticket to do a little space tour?  Bezos: The first tourism vehicle - we won't be selling tickets yet - we may put humans in it at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year. We're getting very close, we've been working on it for years. And we are building a very large orbital vehicle, we've been working on that for more than 5 years. It'll fly for the first time in 2020, and the key is reusability.  This civilization I'm talking about of getting comfortable living and working in space and having millions of people and then billions of people and then finally a trillion people in space? You can't do that with space vehicles that you use once and then throw away. It's a ridiculous, costly way to get into space.

[],,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Axel Springer CEO Mathias D√∂pfner discuss the need to regulate large tech companies, the possibility of breaking up Amazon, and the importance of scrutinizing big institutions. Following is a transcript of the video.  D√∂pfner: But, your most prominent critic at the moment is the President of the United States. People are even saying that he may be willing to prepare initiatives to break up Amazon, because it's too big, it's too successful, it's too dominant in too many sectors, or for varied other reasons, including the fact that he doesn't like the ""Post"". Is this break up scenario something that you take seriously, or do you think it's just a fantasy?  Bezos: For me again, this is one of those things where I focus on and ask our teams to focus on what we can control, and I expect - whether it's the current US administration or any other government agency around the world - Amazon is now a large corporation and I expect us to be scrutinized. We should be scrutinized. I think all large institutions should be scrutinized and examined. It's reasonable. And one thing to note about is that we have gotten big in absolute terms only very recently. So we've always been growing very fast in percentage terms, but in 2010 just 8 years ago, we had 30,000 employees. So in the last 8 years we've gone from 30,000 employees to 560,000 employees. You know in my mind I'm still delivering the packages to the post office myself. You see what I'm saying? I still have all the memories of hoping that one day we could afford a forklift. So obviously my intellectual brain knows that's just not the case anymore. We have 560,000 employees all over the world . And I know we should be scrutinized and I think it's true that big government institutions should be scrutinized, big non-profit institutions should be scrutinized, big universities should be scrutinized. It just makes sense. And that's, by the way, why the work at the ""Washington Post"" and all other great newspapers around the world do is so important. They are often the ones doing that initial scrutiny, even before the government agencies do.  D√∂pfner: The general sentiment concerning the big innovative tech companies has changed. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple - they used to be seen as the nice guys in T-shirts that are saving the world. Now they are sometimes portrayed as the evil of the world. And the debate about the Big 4 or the Big 5 is heating up: Professors like Scott Galloway and ""The Economist"" are suggesting a split-up, other powerful people like George Soros are giving very critical speeches at Davos, and the EU Commission is taking pretty tough positions here. Do you think that there is a change in the mindset of society, and how should the big tech companies, how should Amazon deal with that?  Bezos: I think it's a natural instinct, I think we humans, especially in the western world, and especially inside democracies are wired to be skeptical and mindful of large institutions of any kind. We're skeptical always of our government in the United States, state governments and local governments. I assume it's similar in Germany. It's healthy, because they're big, powerful institutions - the police, the military, or whatever it is. It doesn't mean you don't trust them, or that they're bad or evil or anything like that. It's just that they have a lot of power and control, and so you want to inspect them. Maybe that's a better word. You kind of want to always be inspecting them. And if you look at the big tech companies, they have gotten large enough that they need and are going to be inspected. And by the way, it's not personal. I think you can go astray on this if you're the founder of a company - one of these big tech companies, or any other big institution. If you go astray on this, you might start to take it personally. Like ""Why are you someone inspecting me?"" And I wish that people would just say, ""Yes, it's fine"".

[],2018-05-04 09:08:00-07:00,"Via Jeff Bezos/Twitter  The world is far too often a miserable, divided place. But thankfully, we all have Jeff Bezos to lift our spirits.  Richard Guttfield, the owner of a printing business in England, told The Sun that his black miniature schnauzer Wilma went missing after a driver dropped off an Amazon package of dog food, allegedly making off with the dog, the publication reported Thursday.  Guttfield, 51, said he alerted Amazon about the issue but claimed the company started to take his concerns seriously only after he emailed Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, whose email address is widely known as jeff@amazon.com. No, Bezos -- who's the world's richest person -- didn't fly to Britain and, after several long nights of detective work while doing his best Liam Neeson impression, break up a secret cabal of notorious puppy thieves.  Instead, according to The Sun, Amazon checked the GPS log of the van the driver used, and Rob Levy of Amazon logistics eventually called Guttfield with the good news.  The driver, who is not an Amazon employee, was part of Amazon's network of independent courier companies it contracts for package deliveries.  ""This is inexcusable and does not reflect the high standards we have for our delivery partners,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement Friday. ""We take these matters seriously and this individual is no longer delivering Amazon packages for the independent delivery service provider.""","Amazon's Jeff Bezos rescues puppy, well sort of"
[],,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos intervened to help reunite a British customer with their stolen dog.  Schnauzer Wilma went missing last week and was found in the home of a delivery driver who was employed by a company contracted by Amazon.  Wilma's owner Richard Guttfield emailed Bezos directly after growing frustrated with the lack of urgency from the Amazon customer services team.  Bezos has said that he reads most customer emails - and forwards them on to the relevant executive with a simple call to action.    Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos intervened to help a desperate customer find a stolen dog.  Richard Guttfield said Wilma, his 11-month-old miniature schnauzer, vanished from his home in Hertfordshire, UK, last Friday after he received an Amazon delivery.  For the three days after Wilma disappeared, Guttfield told Business Insider that he made ""non-stop"" attempts to convince the Amazon customer services team to investigate. It was only after he emailed CEO Bezos in desperation, however, that the company swung into action.  Wilma was returned to Guttfield earlier this week after being found in the home of the delivery driver, who worked for an unnamed Amazon logistics supplier. Amazon located the driver using its tracking software, Guttfield said. The motive for the theft is not clear and the police are now investigating.  Amazon said there was no excuse for the incident. ""This is inexcusable and does not reflect the high standards we have for our delivery partners,"" a spokesman said.  ""We take these matters seriously and this individual is no longer delivering Amazon packages for the independent delivery service provider.""  Guttfield was angry that it took an email to the CEO for Amazon to take the issue seriously. He said:  ""Nobody appeared to have the authority to look into this quickly. All we wanted was the drivers' details so we could ask if he saw the dog. We weren't on a witch hunt.  ""It was rather a long shot to go right to the top and email Jeff Bezos, but then all of a sudden things started to happen. We got a reply from someone who said he [Jeff] was in receipt of my email and had asked him to contact us.  ""It was in a sense [reassuring], but something that was pretty serious in the outset was pretty much ignored for three or four days. You never know what could have happened to the dog and we would have appreciated some sort of help sooner.""  Bezos said last month that he still personally reads ""most"" customer-complaint emails sent to him - and if he believes they should be dealt with, he forwards them on with single character message.  ""I see most of those emails. I see them and I forward them to the executives in charge of the area with a question mark. It's shorthand [for], 'Can you look into this?' 'Why is this happening?'"" Bezos said.  Guttfield, who runs small tech firm 4quotes4me in Britain, was happy to have Wilma home but said the dog was a little out of sorts.

[],,"When Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was 10 years old, he took a road trip with his grandparents that forever changed his life.  During the ride, he did something that caused his grandmother to burst into tears.  His grandfather pulled over, had him get out of the car and told him this: 'it's harder to be kind than clever.'  The incident had a profound impact on Bezos, and perhaps explains a lot about Amazon's corporate culture.  Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was clearly a precocious child.  Bezos spent his summers with his grandparents on their south Texas ranch, in part to give his young parents a breather. He was born to a teenaged mother, who married Cuban immigrant Miguel Bezos when he was four years old.  That time on the ranch is where his grandfather taught him about self-reliance, everything from how to fix equipment to how to care for a sick cow, Bezos said. And he learned lots of life lessons he carries with him today, he said.  Bezos' remarks came during an on-stage interview with Mathias D√∂pfner, the CEO of Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company. The interview was part of an awards event in Berlin hosted by Business Insider's US editor-in-chief, Alyson Shontell.  During those days on the ranch, his grandfather also dispensed plenty of words of wisdom, he said.  One major example came when Bezos was 10 years old. This was in 1974, when there was a big public health movement to get people to stop smoking, and anti-smoking commercials were airing constantly.  ""One of the advertisements had this figure in it,"" Bezos recalled on stage. ""It said something like 'every puff of a cigarette takes so many minutes off your life. I can't remember, I think it was 2 minutes.""  Bezos knew his grandmother was a chain smoker.  ""So I sat at the back of this car ride and calculated how many minutes she had taken off her life. In my 10-year-old-mind, I had been extremely clever to do this. When I finished with my arithmetic, I proudly announced to her how many years she had taken off her life,"" he said.  Her response was to burst into tears. Bezos was shocked and surprised, never expecting that reaction.  ""So my grandfather stopped the car and he took me out,"" Bezos remembers.  ""And I had no idea what was going to happen because he had never said a cross word to me. And I thought, he might actually be angry with me,"" he said.  But he wasn't. His grandfather simply wanted to talk to him in privacy.  And his grandfather said, ""You are going to figure out one day, that's it's harder to be kind than to be clever.""  Bezos never forgot that story or that wisdom.  And it explains a lot about Amazon because some would say the culture at his company can sometimes be more clever than kind.  While Amazon is often kind to its customers -- it is obsessive about great customer service -- the company has the reputation that its focus on employee productivity and meeting data-driven targets can make Amazon a hard, sometimes even cruel place to work  Amazon workers tell stories of peeing in bottles in the warehouse, because the bathroom was too from the work floor and their output was so carefully measured, they were afraid using attending to their body's needs would cause them to miss their work targets. They also tell of getting penalized for talking to their coworkers.  ""The metrics are brutally aggressive, and most of my colleagues are in a state of constant anxiety that we could be fired at any moment for not meeting metrics,"" one current US warehouse employee recently told Business Insider reporter Shona Ghosh.  On the other hand, while Bezos is the first to admit that Amazon measures everything in detail, he has also recently said that the true key to running a business is listening to people, particularly customers.  ""The thing I have noticed is when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right. There's something wrong with the way you are measuring it,"" he recently explained.",Young Jeff Bezos once made his grandmother burst into tears - and it taught him an important lesson on how to treat people

He explained that the analysts he attacked on the call don't represent investors but short sellers and the ""short thesis"" was behind their questions.  Lukomnik at investor watchdog IRRC expressed some sympathy for Musk's frustration with questions about issues like quarterly gross margin. He said more CEOs should work to change the narrative and focus on the ""strategic pan,"" and ""investors could help by asking those types of questions, but right now the general dynamic is a short-term 'did you meet your quarter, what is guidance?'""  But Musk, having over-promised and under-delivered on key milestones while burning cash, isn't the best CEO to play that ""strategic pan"" role right now.  The truth is, even though Tesla's 2010 IPO was considered a success, there's a part of Tesla management that still regrets having to go public. Comments given over the years by Tesla CFO Deepak Ahuja illustrate how the company feels about the quarterly dance. Speaking last year to an audience in India, he said, ""An IPO is just a milestone in the journey; it's not the end at all. It just makes life difficult. You've got to start delivering every quarter, which is quite painful compared to having slightly longer term strategy and vision and the right investors who go along with that ride.""  Ahuja also explained why the company went public. ""It was the best way to get capital at the lowest cost possible.""  Ahuja explained that unlike most Silicon Valley start-ups, being an automotive company means having an asset-intensive, brick-and-mortar business model that venture capitalists aren't likely to back. ""We knew we needed billions of dollars, and no VC in the Valley was going to give us even $100 million, because they're just not used to funding brick-and-mortar companies like Tesla.""  Morgan Stanley's research team issued its own statement of annoyance: ""While they may be 'dry' in nature, we argue such questions are extremely important for a highly levered and cash hungry company with 2025 bonds trading at 89. ... Feedback we have received from investors during and following the call support this view. ... an important part of Tesla's success has been its relationship with the capital markets in funding its ambitious plans. The analysts on the call represent the providers of capital that Tesla has throughout its history depended upon.""  The shorts ‚Äî which recently ratcheted up short interest in Tesla to 30 percent of its publicly available shares ‚Äî are smelling blood.  Some of the things Musk said are good reminders about long-term investing for individuals:  ""The problem is that people get too focused on what is happening in the space of a few weeks, or a few months. It is an old maxim of investing: You should not be focused on short-term things, you should be focused on long-term things.""  ""We have no interest in satisfying the desires of day traders, we could care less ‚Äî please sell our stock, don't buy it.""  "" If people are concerned about volatility, they should definitely not buy our stock. ... D o not buy it if volatility is scary.""  All true, but better said by a Warren Buffett or Jack Bogle when preaching the benefits of investing in broad index funds, not a single, highly levered stock that recently saw its bonds downgraded by Moody's and its credit situation switched from ""stable"" to ""negative.""  Tesla is not even the Tesla version of an index fund.  There remain many things about Tesla that the Larry Finks of the world like. Fink didn't stop writing letters after his 2016 missive on long-term investing. Last year Fink wrote a letter calling on all investors to support corporations that promote social change.  ""Increasingly, ownership lies with index funds and others who express their opinions through engagement, proxy voting and other stewardship tools, rather than buying and selling,"" IRRC's Lukomnik said. ""But the ethos of the calls hasn't changed to meet the needs of these universal owners, who may, in fact, have a longer-term perspective. For example, ESG/sustainability issues rarely get mentioned. Yet you see the Blackrocks and State Streets of the world saying they care about those issues as active owners.""  Musk and Ahuja are trying to accomplish a lot more than your average index fund or ETF, or Silicon Valley start-up. ""There has been no successful American car company in 100 years, and then to make it an electric car company in California that is vertically integrated in its manufacturing, and wants to challenge the dealership network, and do its own sales and service; that's an incredibly hard thing to take on.""  But once you take the money, to expect to be able to run is, even for Musk, asking for too much credit.

[],,"The founder of Blue Origin and Amazon, Jeff Bezos, was recently interviewed by the CEO of Axel Springer, Mathias D√∂pfner. Bezos talked about why he considers Blue Origin to be above anything else he does. Following is a full transcript of the video.  Mathias D√∂pfner: ... Could you share with us the vision of Blue Origin and the idea of space tourism with reusable rockets?  Jeff Bezos: Yes. This is super important to me, and I believe on the longest timeframe - and really here I'm thinking of a timeframe of a couple of hundred years, so over millions of decades - I believe and I get increasing conviction with every passing year, that Blue Origin, the space company, is the most important work that I'm doing. And so there is a whole plan for Blue Origin.  D√∂pfner: Really, so you'd say retail, e-commerce, clouds, publishing - that's all less relevant than the space project.  Bezos: Yes, and I'll tell you why. First of all, of course, I'm interested in space, because I'm passionate about it. I've been studying it and thinking about it since I was a five-year-old boy. But that is not why I'm pursuing this work. I'm pursuing this work, because I believe, if we don't, we will eventually end up with a civilization of stasis, which I find very demoralizing. I don't want my great-grandchildren's great-grandchildren to live in a civilization of stasis. We all enjoy a dynamic civilization of growth and change. Let's think about what powers that. We are not really energy-constrained. Let me give you just a couple of numbers. If you take your body - your metabolic rate as a human it's just an animal, you eat food, that's your metabolism - you burn about a 100 Watts. Your power, your body is the same as a 100-Watt light bulb. We're incredibly efficient. Your brain is about 60 Watts of that. Amazing. But if you extrapolate in developed countries where we use a lot of energy, on average in developed countries our civilizational metabolic rate is 11 000 Watts. So, in a natural state, where we're animals, we're only using a 100 Watts. In our actual developed-world state, we're using 11 000 Watts. And it's growing. For a century or more, it's been compounding at a few percent a year - our energy usage as a civilization.  Now if you take baseline energy usage globally across the whole world and compound it at just a few percent a year for just a few hundred years, you have to cover the entire surface of the Earth in solar cells. That's the real energy crisis. And it's happening soon. And by soon, I mean within just a few 100 years. We don't actually have that much time. So what can you do? Well, you can have a life of stasis, where you cap how much energy we get to use. You have to work only on efficiency. By the way, we've always been working on energy efficiency, and still we grow our energy usage. It's not like we have been squandering energy. We have been getting better at using it with every passing decade. So, stasis would be very bad I think.  Now take the scenario, where you move out into the Solar System. The Solar System can easily support a trillion humans. And if we had a trillion humans, we would have a thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts and unlimited (for all practical purposes) resources and solar power unlimited for all practical purposes. That's the world that I want my great-grandchildren's great-grandchildren to live in.  By the way, I believe that in that timeframe we will move all heavy industry off of Earth and Earth will be zoned residential and light industry. It will basically be a very beautiful planet. We have sent robotic probes to every planet in this solar system now and believe me this is the best one.  D√∂pfner: Jeff when can I buy the first ticket to do a little space tour.  Bezos: We are going to be‚Ä¶ So the first tourism vehicle - we won't be selling tickets yet - but we may put humans in it at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year. We are very close. We are building a very large orbital vehicle. We have been working on that for more than five years. It will fly for the first time in 2020. The key is reusability. This civilization I'm talking about of getting comfortable living and working in space and having millions of people and then billions of people and then finally a trillion people in space - you can't do that with space vehicles that you use once and then throw away. It's a ridiculous, costly way to get into space.",Jeff Bezos: Blue Origin is 'the most important work that I'm doing'

Tweeting after Blue Origin's successful launch of its New Shepard rocket in April of that year, Bezos explained that the boots were given as a gift from a friend.  In June 2016, after the New Shepard rocket's fourth launch, he sported them again, tweeting, ""Careful engineering plus of course ‚Ä¶ the lucky boots. Successful mission.""  The cowboy boots may be a nod to Bezos' Texas roots, where he spent summers on his grandfather's ranch, working with cattle and repairing windmills. Today, Bezos owns over 300,000 acres of land in West Texas, according to The Wall Street Journal, and Blue Origin's testing base is on a 30,000 acre ranch outside of Van Horn, Texas.  But the boots aren't just about luck or Texas fashion. The Latin phrase ""gradatim ferociter"" written down the side is Blue Origin's motto, and it symbolizes the company's approach to space flight, Bezos says.  ""It means step by step ferociously,"" Bezos said in an interview with Four Peaks TV in 2013.  ""Basically, you can't skip steps. You have to put one foot in front of the other. Things take time.

There's also one more symbol that Bezos has explained ‚Äî the winged hourglass in the company crest. It's to remind employees to accomplish tasks with passion, he said.

The Amazon chief executive has complained he has so much money, the only thing he can think to blow it on is his Blue Origin space tourism project.  Bezos was in Germany last month to pick up the Axel Springer Award for being such an innovative person, and gave an extensive interview to the German publisher outlining his philosophy. In it he was asked, as the world's richest man with a net worth of $130.8bn, what money meant to him now.  ""The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel. That is basically it,"" Bezos said.  ""I am very lucky that I feel like I have a mission-driven purpose with Blue Origin that is, I think, incredibly important for civilization long term. And I am going to use my financial lottery winnings from Amazon to fund that.""  So desperate is Bezos to blast off into orbit and beyond, he's forgotten one thing. Earth. As in, the people on it right now. Specifically, the people who work for him, who made him rich, and the cities in which they live. They are being left behind in more ways than one as the internet baron prepares to lift off into the heavens.  Star trekking  Now obviously, humankind has to get off this overcrowded, resource-limited rock at some point, and explore the obsidian void, so thinking long term here is no bad thing. We've got to establish ourselves elsewhere. Key words here are long and term. Right now, there's somewhere closer to home Bezos could splash some of his cash.  Mannequin Skywalker takes high ground on Bezos-backed rocket READ MORE  Take, for example, Amazon's poorly paid warehouse workers, who toil away in such grueling conditions that some pee in bottles to save time between sorting parcels. Bezos was asked to respond to these criticisms of his e-souk, of its hiring and employment practices. He tried dodging the question by talking about the 1984 Kindle cockup before releasing this zinger.  ""I'm very proud of our working conditions and very proud of the wages we pay,"" he said. ""You know, in Germany we employ 16,000 people, and we pay at the high end of the range for any comparable work.""  What he neglected to mention was that German workers are paid so well because they held multiple strikes to force Amazon to actually pay a decent wage, and were supported by strong national employment laws that allowed them to do so. In America the situation is very different.  Work peons! Work!  In order to deliver shiny new things to internet buyers at such a rapid pace, Amazon has set up a network of warehouses, typically in depressed areas of the US where wages are relatively low and kept relatively low. It employs about 125,000 staff, who are constantly timed and critiqued on their performance, plus tens of thousands more temp workers at peak sales periods.  A study published in January by The Economist found that warehouse staff employed in America by Amazon earned about 10 per cent less than other nearby warehouse workers. When Amazon arrives in your town, the average salary for warehouse workers drops by three per cent.  Your humble hack can't put it any other way. Wages in Amazon's warehouses, and in its other facilities, are low. One study from non-profit PolicyMatters Ohio earlier this year showed that about 11.8 per cent of Amazon workers are on food stamps ‚Äì they're so poorly paid by multibillionaire Bezos that the government subsidizes their meals. Sorry, the American taxpayers subsidize their meals.  To add insult to injury, Amazon's own Go stores, which eliminate the need to employ human cashiers, don‚Äôt even accept food stamps. Its own workers have to shop elsewhere.  To be fair, this isn‚Äôt just an Amazon issue. Several large companies, including Walmart, are infamous for paying wages so low that the taxpayer sometimes has to fill in the gap. But when you're the world's richest man, is being part of this ensemble of cold-hearted bastards something you are ""very proud"" of?  But, I hear you say, Amazon pays hefty amounts of tax so it all works out in the end. Not so in Amazon's case.  For 2017, Amazon paid zero dollars and zero cents in US federal income taxes. It accomplished this using legal loopholes and offsets, rather than by cheating. There were various tax breaks, credits, and deferments that brought what should have been about $1.3bn in federal taxes down to nothing despite booking an income of $5.6bn. It paid about $769m total in taxes, although $724m of that went overseas.  In other words, Amazon did pay millions in US state and foreign taxes, but not to Uncle Sam centrally. And no doubt someone will chime in to say that if Amazon pays more in taxes and wages then its prices will rise and everyone loses, and obviously this is a moronic train of thought.  The biz is also operating a Battle Royale-style contest to decide where to put its second headquarters. US cities eager to host Bezos' bunch have been encouraged to offer the firm a host of tax breaks in return for the privilege of hosting Amazon workers.  And then there's the hypocrisy  During the interview, Bezos burnished his charitable credentials by waxing lyrically about a homeless shelter called Mary's Place, in Seattle, Amazon's birthplace and corporate base. This shelter had opened his eyes to the importance of charity work.  That's a rather unfortunate example, as it turns out. Days after the interview, Amazon went head to head with the city of Seattle about the homeless situation, and made it clear it has no intention of helping sort it out. Seattle, which has a non-trivial homeless problem, is mulling a new tax, based on company headcounts in the city, to fund solutions to alleviate the situation. On Wednesday, it was reported that Amazon has halted plans to expand in the city because there is no way it is shelling out extra bucks per staffer in Seattle to help the homeless.  ‚ÄúI can confirm that pending the outcome of the head tax vote by City Council, Amazon has paused all construction planning on our Block 18 project in downtown Seattle and is evaluating options to sublease all space in our recently leased Rainier Square building,‚Äù Amazon Vice President Drew Herdener told the Seattle Times.  Maybe Bezos is planning to offer homeless people in its home city a new chance in the off-world colonies, but somehow we doubt it. ¬Æ  Sponsored: Unleash the potential of all-flash storage in your Data Center with Huawei","I've got way too much cash, thinks Jeff Bezos.

Bezos is the CEO and founder of Amazon, the source of his $131 billion fortune, which he thinks will be easy to blow through.  Bezos' Blue Origin aims to send people to space and eventually, have human settlements beyond Earth.  Most people feel like they blow through their money too quickly, but it may be difficult imagining spending your way through a $131 billion fortune.  Yet, even the richest person in the world thinks he will go through all of his wealth. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said as much in an interview with Mathias D√∂pfner, the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, and Business Insider US editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell.  ""The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel,"" Bezos said. ""I am going to use my financial lottery winnings from Amazon to fund that.""  Bezos plans to spend his fortune - the largest wealth in the world - on space travel through Blue Origin, which he called his most important project.  ""I get increasing conviction with every passing year, that Blue Origin, the space company, is the most important work that I'm doing. And so there is a whole plan for Blue Origin,"" Bezos said in Berlin after winning the Axel Springer Award 2018.  While it may be unfathomable to spend over $100 billion on any venture, Bezos is confident that space travel can lighten his purse.  ""That is basically it. Blue Origin is expensive enough to be able to use that fortune. I am liquidating about $1 billion a year of Amazon stock to fund Blue Origin. And I plan to continue to do that for a long time,"" Bezos said.  However much Bezos invests in Blue Origin, he will still have money to spend on his family. Discussing a recent family vacation to Norway, Bezos highlighted the fact that he doesn't feel as if he needs to hold onto all of his money for personal use.  ""I have lots of pleasures, and we just came back from an amazing trip with the kids, MacKenzie and I did,"" Bezos said. ""We went to Norway for three days and we stayed in an ice hotel. We went dogsledding. We went to a wolf preserve and actually got to interact with timber wolves. It really was an incredible vacation, a pretty incredible holiday. We got it all done in three and a half days.""  Space is not a new frontier for the founder of Amazon. According to him, Bezos is ""interested in space, because I'm passionate about it.

""You're not going to spend it on a second dinner out. That's not what we are talking about,"" Bezos said. ""I am very lucky that I feel like I have a mission-driven purpose with Blue Origin that is, I think, incredibly important for civilization long term.""

It involves a seafaring ship that'll catch a returning booster without stopping.  Blue Origin, owned by Amazon founder and current billionaire king Jeff Bezos, revealed Sunday that it hopes to gain a competitive advantage over Elon Musk and his SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets by keeping some motion in the ocean.  During the webcast of Sunday's eighth test launch of Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket, host Ariane Cornell filled some time during a countdown hold by talking about the space company's upcoming New Glenn rocket. New Glenn is a larger launch system that will be able to send satellites and other payloads to orbit, making it a more direct competitor for SpaceX. The Shepard rocket is designed to take adventurous tourists on suborbital flights to the edge of space.  Like the Falcon 9, New Glenn will be able to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and then return to land on a ship at sea, but the Blue Origin ship won't be parked at a designated landing spot in the Atlantic. Instead it'll be in motion, plying the waters, even as New Glenn comes in for a landing.  ""It's actually more stable than a barge out there, which means that we can actually launch and land in higher sea states,"" Cornell explained, throwing some not-so-subtle shade at SpaceX. ""It means we can have a more reliable schedule for our customers."" Cornell works for Blue Origin in business development and strategy.  SpaceX declined to comment.  Rough waters have forced SpaceX to abandon plans to recover one of its Falcon 9 rockets as recently as March. To be fair, though, the waters were very treacherous that day with swells of nearly 20 feet (6 meters).  Time will tell what, if any, type of competitive advantage Blue Origin can gain over Musk and SpaceX, which has a significant head start when it comes to launching and then landing orbital class rockets carrying big payloads.  New Glenn isn't expected to go into service until the 2020s. By then it's possible that SpaceX will have conducted dozens more sea landings (the company has already done 13 successfully) and also figured out how to catch a rocket with a moving ship.

One step closer. #GradatimFerociter @BlueOrigin ‚Äî Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) April 29, 2018  The first booster met a somewhat fiery end on its first flight in 2015. The crew capsule was recovered by parachute after reaching 307,000 feet but the booster suffered a loss of hydraulic pressure and did not survive the landing. The second booster flew later in 2015 and made it back to the ground in one piece.  SpaceX performed a similar feat a month later with the orbital-class Falcon 9 touching down in Florida.  As well as an instrumented dummy dubbed ""Mannequin Skywalker"", the eighth flight was loaded with payloads from commercial customers including experiments from NASA to collect environmental data from within the crew cabin and test components planned for the agency's own Orion capsule.  Blue Origin is now looking at putting humans in the capsule, possibly this year, to enjoy a brief jaunt to space and back as well as a short spell of weightlessness while gazing out of the capsule's windows.  While the single-stage version of the New Shepard is only capable of a sub-orbital lob with its single BE-3 engine providing 110,000 pounds of thrust, its follow-up, the New Glenn, will be an altogether different beast.  Seven BE-4 engines will deliver a combined 3.85 million pounds of thrust, delivering payloads to orbit and beyond.  Elon Musk's rocketeers are likely to cough politely and point at their Falcon Heavy system, which delivers quite a bit more in terms of Tesla lifting ability.

In the suborbital space tourism arena, Blue Origin will be competing with Virgin Galactic, a company owned by Virgin-founder Richard Bransom that is developing a rocket-powered spaceplane to carry tourists on suborbital flights to the edge of space.  Neither company has announced when they plan to launch the first private citizens.",Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launches rocket in smooth test flight
"['Kathryn Dill', 'Javier E. David', 'Photo Courtesy Blue Origin']",2018-04-28 00:00:00,"Jeff Bezos believes his space company, Blue Origin ‚Äî rather than Amazon or the Washington Post ‚Äî is representative of his ""most important work,"" and imperative for humanity's long-term survival, the mogul said in an interview published on Business Insider.  In a wide-ranging sitdown on the eve of a new rocket launch, Bezos said his vision for an interplanetary human society actually began as a child, and is culminating with the private space venture that's in a race with SpaceX to send humans into outer space. On Sunday, Blue Origin ‚Äî which has an ambitious plan to send tourists beyond the Earth as early as this year ‚Äî is expected to launch its first rocket of 2018 on Sunday.  In an interview with the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, the billionaire was asked whether he considered space exploration more important than his other ventures.  ""Yes,"" Bezos replied. Sending humans to outer space ""is super important to me. I believe on the longest time frame ‚Äî and really here I'm thinking of a time frame of a couple hundred years, so over many decades...that Blue Origin, the space company, is the most important work I'm doing.""  His response was somewhat surprising, in the context of Bezos having built his online retail company into a global behemoth, and having purchased the venerable Washington Post in 2013. And just last year, Bezos sent shockwaves through the food retail industry by snapping up Whole Foods.  He added that ""I'm pursuing this work because I believe if we don't, we will eventually end up with a civilization of stasis, which I find very demoralizing."" Humans ""all enjoy a dynamic civilization of growth and change,"" and space travel is integral to that continuing, he said.  Bezos predicted that heavy industry will be moved to other planets, while Earth, he said, would be reserved for living and for light industry. He also told Business Insider that he grows increasingly convinced of the necessity for space exploration and development ""with every passing year.""  Blue Origin, which Bezos invests $1 billion in each year, is set to launch its New Shepherd rocket on Sunday morning from the company's facility near Van Horn, Texas. It will be the rocket's eight launch and its first flight of 2018.

[],,"Axel Springer CEO Mathias D√∂pfner sat down with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to talk about the early days of creating Amazon, what he's learned since then, how he funds his rocket company Blue Origin, and what it's like when the president of the United States is your biggest critic.  The sit-down interview happened in Berlin, Germany, where Bezos received the Axel Springer Award 2018. You can read the complete transcript of their talk below.  Mathias D√∂pfner: Jeff, welcome to Berlin.  Thanks, it's great to be here.  D√∂pfner: I have to tell you, when we were sitting in the first row just a couple of minutes ago when the heartbeat was there, Jeff looked at me and I was breathing in and out and he looked at me and asked, ""Matias are you nervous?"" I said, ""Yes, I'm always nervous on occasions like that."" And he said, ""So am I."" I said, ""Really? ""The richest man in the world is nervous ""because he receives the Axel Springer Award?"" So be a bit forgiving, we are both nervous. Jeff, we are so glad to really celebrate you tonight. Most importantly apart from all the reasons that we heard because you are a role model for other young founders, entrepreneurs who really have great ideas, crazy ideas, unconventional ideas and need encouragement to simply do it and go for it and you have shown that to the world. So that is really, for me, the most important thing and in that context the first question, you used to work in New York as an investment banker. So an investment banker is actually the exact opposite of an entrepreneur, he's delegating risk to other people and basically, how did you find out or how did you think that you should move from investment banking to really launch a company?  Bezos: I think I'd always wanted to do it ever since I was a kid, had the idea, every time I look at something, it looks like it could be improved, there's something wrong with it so I go through it like how could this restaurant be better, so I've always had that kind of idea. By the way, before we really get into this, how about this amazing production that you and your team have put together? This is truly incredible for its originality like these boxes that you were filming live that's just crazy cool so thank you. Truly it's incredible. But I think the great thing about humans in general is we're always improving things. And so entrepreneurs and inventors, they follow their curiosity and they follow their passions and they figure something out, and then they figure out how to make it better and they're never satisfied. And you need to harness, in my view, you need to harness that energy primarily on your customers instead of on your competitors. And so I sometimes see companies and even young small start-up companies, entrepreneurs, go awry - they start to pay more attention to their competition than they do to their customers. And I think that in big mature industries that might be a winning approach in some cases, kind of close following, let other people be the pioneers and go down the blind allies, there are so many things that a new, inventive company tries won't work and so those mistakes and errors and failures do cost real money. And so maybe in a mature industry where growth rates are slow and change is very slow. But as you see in the world more and more, there aren't very many mature industries, change is happening everywhere. You see it in the automobile industry with self-driving cars, but you could go right down the line of every industry and you would see it.  D√∂pfner: Do you have any idea where your ambition really comes from? What was driving you?  Bezos: I really don't know. I've been passionate about certain things forever and I fell in love with computers in fourth grade. I got very lucky. My elementary school had a teletype that got connected to a mainframe computer that some business in downtown Houston donated a little bit of computer time too. This is, you can picture these teletypes, they had the punch tape and they had a 300 bot modem, you would dial up the phone, you'd put it in the cradle. And so we had some time sharing on that mainframe computer and none of the teachers knew how to use it so me and two other kids stayed after school and sort of figured out how to do it, figured it out and kind of taught ourselves programming from books. I think one thing is I got very lucky early in my childhood. Look, we all get gifts, we get certain things in our life that we're very lucky about, and one of the most powerful ones is who your early role models are.  D√∂pfner: It was your grandfather.  It was in a big sense. My mom and dad but my grandfather too. My mom had me when she was 17 years old and she was still in high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico and this is in 1964. I can assure you that being a pregnant teenager in high school was not cool in Albuquerque, New Mexico at that time. So it was difficult for her. My grandfather went to bat for her - they tried to kick her out of school. They're incredible. So the gift I had is I had this incredible family.  D√∂pfner: Could you describe a little bit the role of your grandfather? Because John has mentioned it and I think it was really important.  Bezos: It was super important for me and I spent an unusual amount of time with my grandparents, especially with my grandfather on the ranch. So he had a ranch in South Texas and I would spend my summers there from age four to 16. And when I was four, they were taking me for the summer to kind of give my parents a break, 'cause they were so young and it was useful. I was a handful I'm sure. Anyway, he created the illusion for me when I was four years old that I was helping him on the ranch which of course could not have been true but I believed it and then by the time I was 16 of course I was actually helping on the ranch. I can fix prolapsed cattle, we did all of our own veterinary work. Some of the cattle even survived. And we fixed windmills and laid water pipelines and built fences and barns and fixed the bulldozer that you guys talked about, and so one of the things that's so interesting about that lifestyle and about my grandfather is he did everything himself. He didn't call a vet if one of the animals was sick, he figured out what to do himself.  D√∂pfner: So what does it mean, no delegation?  Bezos: Being resourceful, I think. If there's a problem, there's a solution, and of course as you mature and get into the business world and anything you do on a team, you very quickly realize that it's not about just your own resourcefulness, it's about team resourcefulness and how does that work. But that attitude of my grandfather's was very ... he was full of wisdom. John mentioned the story about the words my grandfather gave to me at one point, of it's harder to be kind than clever. That story, the slightly longer version of that story, 'cause this was really powerful wisdom is that I made my grandmother burst into tears and the way I did it was we were driving on a long road trip and she was a chain smoker and this was, I was probably, I don't know 10 years old so this was around 1974 and it was in a period of time where there were heavy radio advertisements sort of anti-smoking radio advertisements trying to convince people to stop smoking. And one of the advertisements had this figure in it that said something like, every puff of a cigarette takes so many minute off of your life, I think it was two minutes but I can't remember. So I sat there in the backseat on this long car ride and calculated how many years she had taken off of her life and in my 10 year old mind, I had been extremely clever to do this. And so when I was finished with my arithmetic, I proudly announced to her how many years she had taken off of her life and I got a reaction I did not expect with her bursting into tears. So my grandfather stopped the car and he took me out of the car and I had no idea what was about to happen because he had never said a cross word to me and I thought, he might actually be angry with me but he wasn't. He took me out so we had some privacy from her and he said these incredible words, he said, ""You're gonna figure out one day ""that it's harder to be kind than clever.""  D√∂pfner: Wonderful. Actually, your brother also plays an important role, you have a very good relationship. Is it actually true that he's still a firefighter?  Bezos: He is, he's a volunteer firefighter in Scarsdale, New York. He's also the funniest person I know. When I'm with him, I'm just laughing continuously. First of all, I'm a good audience. I laugh easily but he is really very funny and my sister too, we're all very close and I have my mother to thank for that because she worked hard to make sure as we grew up that we stayed close together, and she takes all the grandkids for one week every summer so that me and my sister and our spouses can go on a trip together. So we end up spending a lot of time together.  For me the most moving image that we saw tonight is the one that John showed where you and Mackenzie are preparing the table, the famous table, which is very moving because it shows how you really started from the very scratch and also it illustrates symbolically that the launch of Amazon was really something that you did together. Could you describe a little bit what Mackenzie's role was?  Bezos: Well first of all, Mackenzie, she had married this stable guy working on Wall Street, and a year after we got married, I went to her and said, ""I want to quit my job, move across the country, and start this internet bookstore."" And Mackenzie of course, like everybody that I explained this to, her first question was, ""What's the internet?"" Because nobody knew, this is 1994. But even before she could say what's the internet she said, ""Great, let's go."" Because she wanted to support it and she knew that I had always had this passion for invention and starting a company. And so again, I think, Mackenzie is an example of this, but I was talking about with my mom and my dad, who's a Cuban immigrant, he came to the US when he was 16 [to] a refugee camp in the Everglades - they are so loving and supportive that when you have loving and supportive people in your life like Mackenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risk because I think it's one of those things, it doesn't, you kind of know somebody's got your back and so it's just an, I don't even think you're thinking about it logically, it's an emotional thing.  D√∂pfner: That's really interesting, you think that unconditional love, if you feel and experience unconditional love, it helps you to take risk?  Bezos: And by the way, I think it's probably true of all kinds of risks in life, not just starting a business. Life is full of different risks. So I think that when you think about the things that you will regret when you're 80, they are almost always the things that you did not do, they are acts of omission. Very rarely are you gonna regret something that you did and it failed and didn't work or whatever, but the acts of omission, and again, I'm not just talking about business things, it's like, I loved that person and I never told them and 50 years later you're gonna be like, why didn't I tell her, why didn't I go after it? So that's the kind of life regret that is very hard to be happy about when you're telling yourself in a private moment that story of your life. So I think it's, anyway, I won that lottery, I won that lottery of having so many people in my life who have given me that unconditional love, and I do think Mackenzie's definitely one of those. And so we moved and then Mackenzie, who has basically no skill in this area at all, really, I mean you're the least-suited person for this, she did our accounting for like the first year - was it the first year? Something like that. And she did it well, that's what's amazing. My wife is a novelist, she's won the American Book Award. Toni Morrison, the Nobel prize-winning author who was Mackenzie's teacher at Princeton, said on The Charlie Rose Show that Mackenzie was her best student ever. Anyways, Mackenzie is a very talented novelist but she is not an accountant but she pulled it off. Again, we all get done what we need to get done.  D√∂pfner: Did she then suggest that you focus on the book business at the beginning, being an author?  Bezos: No, I picked books, it is true, she's a big reader, I'm a big reader, but that's not why I picked books. I picked books because there were more items in the book category than any other category, and so you could build universal selection. There were three million in 1994 when I was pulling this idea together, three million different books active in print at any given time, and the largest physical bookstores only had about 150,000 different titles. And so I could see how you could make a bookstore online with universal selection - every book ever printed, even the out-of-print ones - that was the original vision for the company, and so that's why books.  D√∂pfner: And when did you know that Amazon is going to be something way bigger than just a bookstore?  Bezos: Well, I knew that the books, strangely, 'cause I was very prepared for this to take a really long time, I knew that the books business was gonna be successful in the first 30 days. I was shocked at how many books we sold. We were ill prepared. We had only 10 people in the company at that time and most of them were software engineers. So everybody including me and the softwares were all packing boxes - we didn't even have packing tables - and we were on our hands and knees on a concrete floor packing the boxes, and at about one or two in the morning, I said to one of my software engineering colleagues ""Paul, this is killing my knees, we need to get knee pads."" And Paul looked at me and he's like, ""Jeff, we need to get packing tables."" And I was like, ""Oh my God, that is such a good idea."" The next day I bought packing tables and it doubled our productivity and probably saved our backs and our knees too.  But nevertheless, Amazon had serious crises. In 2002, you went almost bankrupt. So what went wrong and what did you learn from that?  Bezos: We had so many, there've been so many, I haven't had any existential crises, knock on wood, I don't want to jinx anything, but we've had a lot of kind of dramatic events. I remember early on, we only had 125 employees when Barnes and Noble, the big United States bookseller opened their online website to compete against us, barnesandnoble.com. We'd had about a two-year window. We opened in '95, they opened in '97, and at that time, all of the headlines and the funniest were about how we were about to be destroyed by this much larger company, we had 125 employees and $60 million a year in annual sales, $60 million with an ""m"" and Barnes and Noble at the time had 30,000 employees and about three billion dollars in sales. So they were giant, we were tiny and we had limited resources and the headlines were very negative about Amazon and the one that's most memorable was just ""amazon.toast."" And so I called an all-hands meeting, which was not hard to do with just 125 people, and we got in a room 'cause it was so scary for all of us, this idea that now we finally had a big competitor that literally everybody's parents were calling and saying, ""Are you okay?"" It was usually the moms calling and asking their children, are you gonna be okay? And I said, ""Look, it's okay to be afraid but don't be afraid of our competitors because they're never gonna send us any money - be afraid of our customers."" And if we just stay focused on them instead of obsessing over this big competitor that we just got, we'll be fine. And I really do believe that. I think that if you stay focused and the more drama there is and everything else, no matter what the drama is, whatever the external distraction is, your response to it should be to double down on the customer, satisfying them, not just satisfying them, delighting them.  D√∂pfner: Today Amazon is employing 566,000 people. You're probably the biggest job creator of recent times. At the same time, you're aggressively criticized by unions and by media for paying low wages, for inappropriate working conditions. How do you deal with these accusations?  Bezos: Well, first of all, with any criticism, my approach to criticism and what I teach and preach inside Amazon is when you're criticized, first look in a mirror and decide are your critics right? If they're right, change, don't resist.  D√∂pfner: Are they right?  Bezos: No, not in this case, but we've had critics be right before and we've changed. We have made mistakes and I can go through a long list of, probably one of the early most painful ones is - it's so stupid it's hard to believe how we ever did it - but in the early on with the Kindle, maybe the first year of the Kindle or the second year of the Kindle, we had accidentally illegally sold, or given away I guess, copies of the famous novel 1984 because it had a complicated copyright history - it was in copyright in the US and not in the UK or something strange like this so it was in the public domain, but only in certain geographies, and we had screwed that up. And somehow, and this is the kind of mistake that only a corporation can make, an individual can't make this mistake because somehow it happens at the intersections of the different teams. So you've got the legal department saying, ""Oh crap, we've made this mistake"" and you've got the books team. Anyway, the answer that the company came up with was to, without any notice or warning, just electronically go into everybody's Kindle who had downloaded that book and just disappear it. So it would be as if we walked into your bedroom in the middle of the night, found your bookshelf, and just took that book away. And so we were rightly criticized for that and we responded to that. On the issue of working conditions, I'm very proud of our working conditions and I'm very proud of the wages that we pay. In Germany, we employ 16,000 people, we pay at the high end of the range for any comparable work.  D√∂pfner: Will the union fight because the union want to make sure that you are unionized or what is the real substance of the conflict?  Bezos: Well, it's a good question and this is in my longer version of how to deal with critics, there are two kinds of critics: There are well meaning critics who, they're worried it's not gonna work, but they do want it to work, so I could give you an example of customer reviews would be one of those. When we first did customer reviews 20 years ago, some book publishers were not happy about it because some of them were negative and so it was a very controversial practice at that time. But we thought it was right and so we stuck to our guns and had a deep keel on that and didn't change. But there's a second kind of critic which is the self-interested critic and they come in all shapes and sizes. So they can be any kind of institution, competitors, of course, and so when you are doing something in a new way and if customers embrace the new way, what's gonna happen is incumbents who are practicing the older way are not gonna like you and they're gonna be self-interested critics. And so you do need, as you're looking yourself in the mirror, to try and tease those two things apart. In our view, we have workers counsels of course and we have very good communications with our employees. So we don't believe that we need a union to be an intermediary between us and our employees, but of course at the end of the day, it's always the employees' choice and that's how it should be. But for sure, we would be very naive to believe that we're not gonna be criticized. That's just part of the terrain, you have to accept that. One other thing I tell people is if you're gonna do anything new or innovative, you have to be willing to be misunderstood. If you can't afford to be misunderstood, then for goodness sake, don't do anything new or innovative.  Maggie Thatcher said, ""Leadership is not to be pleased by the moment."" But your most prominent critic at the moment is the president of the United States. People are even saying that he may be willing to prepare initiatives to break up Amazon because it's too big, it's too successful, it's too dominant in too many sectors or for other reasons. First of all, is this scenario of a break of something that you take seriously or you think it's just a fantasy?  Bezos: For me, again, this is one of those things where I focus on and ask our teams to focus on what we can control, and I expect, whether it's the current US administration or any other government agency anywhere in the world, Amazon is now a large corporation and I expect us to be scrutinized, we should be scrutinized, I think all large institutions should be scrutinized and examined, it's reasonable. One thing to note about us is that we have gotten big in absolute terms only very recently. So we've always been growing fast in percentage terms, but in 2010, just eight years ago, we had 30,000 employees. So in the last eight years we've gone from 30,000 employees to 560,000 employees. So for us, it's kind of, in my mind, I'm still delivering the packages to the post office myself, you see what I'm saying? I still have all the memories of hoping that one day we could afford a forklift. And so obviously my intellectual brain knows that's just not the case anymore, we have 560,000 employees all over the world and I know we should be scrutinized and I think it's true big government institutions should be scrutinized, big non-profit institutions should be scrutinized, big universities should be scrutinized, it just makes sense. And that's, by the way, why the work that The Washington Post and the other great newspapers around the world do is so important, because they're often the ones doing that initial scrutiny even before the government agencies do.  D√∂pfner: But in a way, the general sentiment towards the big innovative tech companies has changed. Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, they used to be seen as the nice guys in tee shirts that are saving the world and now they are sometimes portrayed as the kind of evil of the world. And the debate about the big four or the big five, The Economist is suggesting a split up, other powerful people like Josh Soros are giving speeches in Davos, the EU Commission is taking pretty a tough positions here. Do you think that there is a change in mindset in the society? And what should the big tech companies, what should Amazon learn from that or do with that?  Bezos: I do sense, I think again, I think it's a natural instinct. I think we humans, especially in the Western world and especially inside democracies, are wired to be skeptical and mindful of large institutions of any kind. We're skeptical of our government always in the United States - state governments, local governments - I assume it's similar in Germany, it's healthy because they're big powerful institutions, the police, the military, whatever it is, it doesn't mean that you don't trust them or that they're bad or evil or anything like that, they're just, they have a lot of power and control and so you want to inspect them, maybe that's a better word, you kind of always want to be inspecting them. And I think if you look at the big tech companies, they have gotten large enough that they're going to be inspected. And by the way, it's not personal. I think where some of the, you can go astray on this if you're the founder of a company, one of these big tech companies or any other big institution, if you go astray on this you might start to take it personally, like why are you inspecting me? And I think that, I wish that people would just say, ""Yes, it's fine.""  D√∂pfner: The whole attitude towards data protection and privacy has always been different between Europe and the United States, but is also at the moment in the context of Cambridge Analytica changing in the United States. What are the consequences for a company like Amazon?  My view on this for Amazon-  D√∂pfner: -Is it hysterical or is it inappropriate?  Bezos: Honestly, I think this is one of the great questions of our age. I think of the internet, so the internet is this big new powerful technology, it's horizontal, it affects every industry. And then if you think of even more broadly tech and machine learning and big data and all these kinds of things, these are big horizontal powerful technologies, and in my view, we've been at scale. The internet is quite old at this point, it's been around a long time, but at scale, it's really only been around 10 or 15 years, 'cause go back in time 20 years, it was tiny. And so at scale, the internet's been around only 10 or 15 years and we haven't learned as a civilization, as a human species, we haven't learned how to operate it yet. So we're still, we as a civilization are still figuring that out. And so it has fantastic, gives us fantastic capabilities. The fact that I can look up almost anything on Wikipedia in five seconds is an unbelievable capability that just simply didn't exist 20 years ago and so on and so on and so on, there's so many good things but we're also finding out that these powerful tools enable some very bad things too, like letting authoritarian governments interfere in free democratic elections around the world. It's an incredibly scary thing.  D√∂pfner: So you're advocating a balance of let's say entrepreneurs who are really moving their businesses forward, politicians and regulators who are finding a certain framework, a society, journalists who are asking unpleasant questions?  Bezos: So my view on Amazon's role in this, which is what you asked me, is I think first of all, we have a duty on behalf of society to try and help educate any regulators, give them our point of view on this sincerely without any cynicism or skepticism, this is what we believe, but it's not ultimately our decision. So we will work with any set of regulations that we're given. Ultimately society decides that, we will follow those rules regardless of the impact they have on our business and we will find a new way if need be to delight customers. So we will always be, again, some of these things, what you have to worry about is the problem, what I would not want to see happen is that you don't want to block invention and innovation. So that's always one of the things, one of the unintended consequences often of regulation is that it really favors the incumbents. Now Amazon at this point is an incumbent, so maybe I should be happy about that, but I wouldn't be because I think for society you really want to see continued progress. So to the degree that we have regulation, you want to be sure that it is incenting innovation and not blocking it, while at the same time protecting. But data security, privacy, encryption, how do you safeguard people's physical safety against terrorists and bad actors all over the world and how do you balance that against privacy? These are very challenging questions.  D√∂pfner: We are running out of time but I have a couple of-  Bezos: We're not gonna answer them in even a few years. I think it's gonna be an ongoing thing.  D√∂pfner: But data security and privacy is going to be a competitive advantage for companies or disadvantage if their not respectful with that?  Bezos: I 100% agree with this and I think with customers, one of the reasons we have been able to extend into new business areas and new product categories, going way back, we just sold books and then we started selling music and DVDs and electronics and toys and so on and then we've extended into electronic reading with Kindle. The reason customers have been receptive in large part to our new initiatives is because we have worked hard to earn trust with them. Earning trust with customers is a valuable business asset and if you mistreat their data, they will know, they will figure it out. Customers are very smart, you should never underestimate customers.  People are getting hungry but I have some brief questions left. You are preparing a second headquarters, it's going to be in the US. Why didn't you consider to do it in Europe?  Bezos: I wanted it in a time zone either in, we looked at Canada, US and Mexico-  D√∂pfner: So it's not an anti-Europe decision, it's for practical reasons.  Bezos: It's not an anti-Europe decision.  D√∂pfner: I'm glad to hear that. When you bought the Post, there were people saying well that's just a personal toy, he wants to have some political influence. Other people thought that is a new strategic element of Jeff's strategy. So what was it?  Bezos: Yeah, of course, you can explain things to people but you can't understand things to people. And so all I can do is say what really my thought process was. And I was not looking to buy a newspaper. It had never even crossed my mind, and so when the opportunity came up, it had only came up because I had known Don Graham at that point for more than 15 years. Any of you who are lucky enough to know Don, knows that he is the most honorable gentleman that you'll ever meet - you know Don very well - he's a remarkable guy and he so loved The Post that he believed, even though this was a huge personal sacrifice for him because it had been in his family for so long, that he needed to find a new home for it. I think he was, there were certain purchasers he was hoping would not end up buying The Post because he wanted it to remain independent. So when he approached me with this I said, ""I'm the wrong guy because I don't know anything about the newspaper business."" And he said, ""That's okay, 'cause we have a lot of people at The Post who know a lot about the newspaper business and what we really need is somebody who knows something more about the internet."" And The Post was in a very difficult financial position at that time and so for me, I had to decide was it hopeless? And I didn't believe it was hopeless, I was optimistic that The Post could be turned around. And then second, I had to decide did I want to put my own time and energy into this? And that for me I just had to ask the simple question, is it an important institution? And the answer to that question is yes, it was very obvious to me, as soon as I thought that way. I was like, okay, I think I actually can help, I can help in two ways. I can provide financial resources while this turnaround occurs and I can also help with my internet knowledge. And then is it an institution worth saving? You bet. It's the most important newspaper in the most important capital city in the Western world. Crazy not to save that newspaper. I'm gonna be very happy when I'm 80 that I made that decision.  D√∂pfner: I assume that you have seen Steven Spielberg's film The Post?  I have, yeah, I've seen it a couple of times.  D√∂pfner: So what is the lesson that you learned from that and could you imagine also to buy and save other newspapers?  Bezos: No, I get that request monthly, I really do and I tell them, no, The Post is it for me, I'm not interested in buying other newspapers. But I watched that movie and it's helpful, I love that movie and also reading Katherine Graham's memoir which won a Pulitzer Prize and is an amazing book because it gets me ready. As the owner of The Post, I know that at times The Post is gonna write stories, they're gonna make very powerful people very unhappy.  D√∂pfner: Are you upset if they are writing critical stories about Amazon, which they do?  Bezos: No, I'm not upset at all.  D√∂pfner: Did you call and interfere?  Bezos: Never, I would be humiliated to interfere. I would be so embarrassed. I would turn bright red and it's nothing to do with, I don't even get so far, I just don't want to. For me, it would feel icky, it would feel gross. It would be one of those things when I'm 80 years old I would be so unhappy with myself if I interfered. Why would I? I want that paper to be independent. So we have a fantastic editor in Marty Baron, we have a fantastic publisher in Fred Ryan, the head of our technology team, a guy named Shilesh, is fantastic. They don't need my help in the newsroom for sure. First of all, that's also an expert's job. It would be like me getting on the airplane and going up to the front of the plane and saying the pilots should move aside, let me do this.  D√∂pfner: You are not getting on the airplane but you are sending workers to the space.  Bezos: That's the best segway ever by the way.  D√∂pfner: Could you share with us briefly the vision of Blue Origin and the idea of kind of space tourism with renewable rockets?  Bezos: This is super important to me. I believe on the longest time frame - and really here I'm thinking of a time frame of a couple hundred years, so over many decades - I believe, and I get increasing conviction with this with every passing year, that Blue Origin, the space company, is the most important work I'm doing. And so there is a whole plan for Blue Origin.  D√∂pfner: Really? So you'd say retail, online ecommerce, publishing, that's all less relevant than the space project?  Bezos: Yes and I'll tell you why. First of all, of course, I'm interested in space because I'm passionate about it and I've been studying it and thinking about it since I was a five-year-old boy, but that is not why I'm pursuing this work. I'm pursuing this work because I believe if we don't, we will eventually end up with a civilization of stasis, which I find very demoralizing. I don't want my great grandchilren's great grandchildren to lie in a civilization of stasis. We all enjoy a dynamic civilization of growth and change and let's think about what powers that. We are not really energy constrained. And so let me give you just a couple of numbers. If you take your body, your metabolic rate as a human as just an animal, you eat food, that's your metabolism, you burn about 100 watts, your power, your body is about 100, it's the same as the 100 watt light bulb, we're incredibly efficient. Your brain is about 60 watts of that, amazing. But if you extrapolate in developed countries where we use a lot of energy, on average in developed countries, our civilizational metabolic rate is 11,000 watts. So in a natural state where we're animals we're only using 100 watts. In our actual developed world state, we're using 11,000 watts and it's growing. For a century or more, it's been compounding at a few percent a year, our energy usage as a civilization. Now if you take baseline energy usage, globally across the whole world, and compound it at just a few percent a year for just a few hundred years, you have to cover the entire surface of the Earth in solar cells. So that's the real energy crisis and it's happening soon, and by soon, I mean within just a few hundred years. And so we don't actually have that much time. So what can you do? Well, you can have a life of stasis where you cap how much energy we get to use, you have to work only on efficiency, by the way, we've always been working on energy efficiency and still we grow our energy usage. It's not like we have been squandering energy, we have been getting better at using it with every passing decade and still we grow it. So stasis would be very bad I think. Now take the alternative scenario where you move out into the solar system. The solar system can easily support a trillion humans, and if we had a trillion humans, we would have 1,000 Einsteins and 1,000 Mozarts and unlimited, for all practical purposes, resources from solar power and so on. Why not, that's the world that I want my great grandchildren's great grandchildren to live in. And by the way, I believe that we'll move all heavy, in that time frame, we will move all heavy industry off of Earth and Earth will be zoned residential and light industry and it will basically be a very beautiful planet. We have sent robotic probes to every planet in this solar system now and believe me, this is the best one. It is not even close.  D√∂pfner: But Jeff, when can I buy the first ticket to do a little space tour?  Bezos: So the first tourism vehicle, we won't be selling tickets yet but we may put humans in it at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year. We're getting very close. We've been working on it for more than 10 years and we're building a very large orbital vehicle, we've been working on that for more than five years. It'll fly for the first time in 2020 and the key is reusability. So you mentioned it. We cannot, this civilization I'm talking about of getting comfortable living and working in space and having millions of people and then billions of people and then finally a trillion people in space you can't do that with space vehicles that you use once and then throw away. It's a ridiculous costly way to get into space.  D√∂pfner: The most recent thing that Amazon is planning is home robots. So I assume it's more than Alexa walking. So what's the vision behind it?  Bezos: I saw that rumor in the press and I can't comment on that.  D√∂pfner: I see, so it seems to be very serious. Jeff, you are one of the most longterm-thinking entrepreneurs. If it is about companies and products and services, if it is about philanthropy, you recently said that you are a very short-term thinker, you really want to deal with the now and here. Can you explain that approach? I think that's also very innovative.  Bezos: And I'm gonna end up doing a mixture of things. We started doing in Seattle, there's a homeless shelter called Mary's Place run by a woman named Marty and that has really impacted my thinking on this issue, because what I'm seeing is that when you, of course I'm in favor of all the, longterm-oriented philanthropy also is a good idea. So I'm not against that. It's just I'm finding I'm very motivated by the here and now there. A lot of the homelessness at Mary's Place works on is transient homelessness. So when you go study homelessness, there are a bunch of causes of homelessness. Mental incapacity issues are a very hard-to-cure problem, serious drug addiction, a very hard-to-cure problem, but there's another bucket of homelessness which is transient homelessness, which is a woman with kids, the father runs away, and he was the only person providing any income and they have no support system, they have no family. That's transient homelessness. You can really help that person. And you by the way, only need to help them for like six to nine months, you get them trained, you get them a job, they're perfectly productive members of society.  D√∂pfner: Last week we had Bill Gates for dinner here and he said that he has a ridiculous amount of money and it's so hard to find appropriate ways to do good with the money. So what does money mean for you being the first person in history that has a net worth of three digit amount of billion?  Bezos: The only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel. So that's basically, Blue Origin is expensive enough to be able to use that fortune, and I'm currently liquidating about a billion dollars a year of Amazon's stock to fund Blue Origin - and I plan to continue to do that for a long time. 'Cause you're right, you're not gonna spend it on a second dinner out. That's not what we're talking about. So for me, I'm very lucky because I feel like I have a mission-driven purpose with Blue Origin that is I think incredibly important for civilization longterm, and I am gonna use my financial lottery winnings from Amazon to fund that.  D√∂pfner: With regard to your personal lifestyle, there are no guilty pleasures that you are doing, unreasonable things?  Bezos: Well, I don't think they're that guilty. I have lots of pleasures and we just came back from an amazing trip with the kids, Mackenzie and I did, she planned the whole thing, it was her birthday trip but she planned it all. We went to Norway for three days and we stayed in an ice hotel, we went dog sledding, we went to a wolf preserve and actually got to interact with these timber wolves. It was really an incredible vacation, an incredible holiday, and we got it all done in three and a half days. So it was amazing.  D√∂pfner: Wonderful. Jeff, John mentioned, it's the last question, John mentioned that you are an ideal family man, your kids are extremely important, you just mentioned that when we spoke earlier. If we would talk to your kids, where would they criticize their dad?  Bezos: They would make fun of my singing.  D√∂pfner: Okay, can we get a- ?  Bezos: No, God no. They would make fun of my inability to remember exact words. I'm always quoting Churchill or something and getting it wrong and they're like, ""That's not even close to what Churchill said."" They would probably, depending on the moment, they might criticize my laugh. They're kids. I'm lucky, I have a very good relationship with them, this work-life harmony thing is what I try to teach young employees, actually, and senior executive at Amazon too, but especially the people coming in. We're asked about work-life balance all the time and my view is that's a debilitating phrase because it implies there's a strict trade off and the reality is if I'm happy at home, I come into the office with tremendous energy, and if I'm happy at work, I come home with tremendous energy. And so it actually is a circle, it's not a balance. And I think that that is worth everybody paying attention to. You never want to be that guy, and we all know, we all have a coworker, who is that person who as soon as they come into the meeting they drain all of the energy out of the room. You can just feel the energy level go whoof - you don't want to be that guy. So you want to come into the office and give everybody a kick in their step.  D√∂pfner: Jeff, thank you very much. We congratulate you for all you have achieved, and congratulations.  Bezos: Very nice, thank you.

['Rubi Valdez'],2018-04-28 00:00:00,"Close  Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, is geared to launch the Blue Origin rocket on April 29 in preparation to send humans to space.  All is set at the Blue Origin's test facility in Van Horn, Texas as Bezos's New Shepard rocket will hopefully board tourist passengers by the end of the year. The launch is scheduled on Sunday, April 29, at 8:30 a.m. Central Time.  In a tweet, Bezos announced the upcoming test launch, which will be complemented with a live stream video and the details of which will soon follow.  ""Launch preparations are underway for New Shepard's 8th test flight, as we continue our progress toward human spaceflight,"" Bezos tweeted on Friday morning.  In December 2017, Blue Origin successfully launched vertically and had reached nearly 61 miles above sea level before the unmanned Crew Capsule 2.0 landed safely on a soft parachute.  The Crew Capsule was aboard a dummy named Mannequin Skywalker. There is no information yet on the name of the dummy for this Sunday's launch.  In a statement, Bob Smith, Blue Origin CEO, said that they want to ensure a safe landing for the passengers. He added saying that their goal is to take passengers higher than 62 miles and let them experience a few minutes of weightlessness.  Reusable Rockets  Both Bezos's Blue Origin and Elon Musk's SpaceX take pride in their mission to build reusable space vehicles. The vertical landing technology allows Blue Origin to reuse both the capsule and the booster.  ""With each flight, [they'll] continuously improve the affordability of space exploration and research, opening the space for all,"" Blue Origin said.  In an interview at the 33rd Space Museum, Bezos said that he funds Blue Origin $1 billion each year through the sale of his Amazon stocks. According to Bezos, his space company is the most important thing that he is doing, adding that he wants to see millions of people working in space and preserving Earth for residential and light industrial purposes.  While New Shepard remains in the testing phase, Blue Origin is also working on another rocket that is said to compete head-to-head with SpaceX's commercial launch contracts.  Like New Shepard, the new rocket is built with reusability in mind. In this case, the rocket offers twice more space for paying passengers. However, New Glenn is not ready until 2020 when it launches in Cape Canaveral in Florida.  Boost In Private Spaceflights  The private spaceflight industry is expected to grow in the coming years especially with the U.S. Congress passing a bill reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration to increase its support to commercial spaceflight activities.  The bill aims to increase the budget allocation for the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation from almost $22.6 million in 2018 to $33 million in 2019 and nearly $76 million by 2023.  The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 will allow aircraft issued with experimental licenses to be used in spaceflight ""support"" activities such as training or hardware tests.  However, these space vehicles will have to launch in an FAA-licensed port, and that individuals who will fly will have to provide their informed consent on the risks associated with an experimental license.

The world's richest man would like to remind you that SpaceX founder Elon Musk isn't the only billionaire hoping to send humans to space as soon as this year.  Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin plans to send its New Shepard rocket on its eighth test flight Sunday, and the commercial space company hopes to start putting humans aboard its vehicles by the end of the year.  The Amazon CEO tweeted Friday morning that preparations are underway for a Sunday launch from Blue Origin's Texas test facility as early as 8:30 a.m. Central Daylight Time.  Launch preparations are underway for New Shepard‚Äôs 8th test flight, as we continue our progress toward human spaceflight. Currently targeting Sunday 4/29 with launch window opening up at 830am CDT. Livestream info to come. @BlueOrigin #GradatimFerociter pic.twitter.com/zAYpAGWB8C ‚Äî Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) April 27, 2018  The most recent test of New Shepard happened in December, when the rocket sent a dummy named ""Mannequin Skywalker"" to the edge of space inside the company's Crew Capsule 2.0. After the capsule separated from the rocket booster, the rocket returned to land not far from its launch point in much the same way SpaceX lands some of its Falcon 9 boosters. The passenger capsule then returned to Earth and a soft parachute landing.  There's been no word yet on any cleverly named dummies riding on Sunday's flight, but Bezos has promised the launch will be livestreamed.  While Bezos' Blue Origin and Musk's SpaceX have similar goals when it comes to using recyclable rockets, it wouldn't be quite right to call the two companies competitors -- at least not yet. SpaceX has dozens of government and commercial satellite launches under its belt, while Blue Origin is still largely in the testing phase for its planned space tourism flights.  The company is working on a larger rocket called New Glenn that could directly compete with SpaceX for commercial launch contracts, but it isn't expected to be ready until 2020.  But being far behind when it comes to building a client list and launch manifest hasn't stopped Bezos and Blue Origin from trolling SpaceX.  A New Shepard rocket was actually the first to touch the edge of space and then land back on Earth in one piece, beating Musk to the punch by about a month.  It's worth noting that SpaceX had an arguably more difficult task figuring out how to land a rocket returning from delivering a suborbital payload rather than just going straight up and down as in the case of New Shepard.  It now seems SpaceX and Blue Origin are again engaged in an undeclared race to be the first to launch humans aboard one of their crew capsules. (SpaceX has used its Dragon capsules for cargo missions to the International Space Station but has yet to send a person to space.)  Blue Origin Chief Executive Bob Smith said last week the company hopes to start launching people later this year, and Musk said in February that SpaceX plans to send a crew to orbit aboard a Dragon capsule in 2018.

He added that ""livestream info"" will be coming soon.  This will be Blue Origin's first flight this year. In December, its seventh New Shepard mission launched, landed and successfully deployed the unmanned Crew Capsule 2.0. It was the company's first launch in 14 months.  Sunday's flight is a continuation of Blue Origin's progress toward sending humans to suborbital space. CEO Bob Smith told CNBC last week he hopes the company will be launching tourists to space on New Shepard this year. He cautioned that the company will only ""go when we're ready.""  ""We want to make sure it's completely safe for our passengers,"" Smith said.  New Shepard ‚Äî named after the first American in space, Alan Shepard ‚Äî launches vertically from the company's facility near Van Horn, Texas. In the seventh test flight, New Shepard's booster reached nearly 61 miles above sea level before the capsule separated. The booster than returned to land on a concrete pad, smoothly coming back to Earth at about 7 miles per hour.  The capsule later touched down on the desert floor at 1 mile per hour. The capsule is designed to hold six astronauts. With its large windows, Crew Capsule 2.0 is built to make it cheaper and easier for humans to experience weightlessness on the edge of space. After disconnecting from New Shepard's booster, the capsule glides in space at three times the speed of sound for a few minutes before gravity pulls the craft into a free fall.

Prime's main advantage is its free shipping. Perhaps in order to keep up those services Amazon may have to raise prices to account for additional cost. However, if the increases did really affect the company, we'd expect to see shipping prices rise across the board including for non-Prime members. And it doesn't look that way for now.  As media costs rise, with competitors like Netflix raising their content budgets up to $8 billion this year, Amazon has to spend more to get rights to TV shows and movies. It's estimated to be spending $4.5 billion for non-sports content in 2017 according to MoffettNathanson, and has an upcoming ""Lord of the Rings"" show with a reportedly whopping $500 million budget.  But its shows have not received the pop-culture resonance that some of its top competitors Netflix and Hulu titles have achieved. A Reuters report found ""The Man in the High Castle"" cost $72 million in production and marketing, but only received 8 million total viewers as of early 2017. It brought in an additional 1.15 million subscribers, at a cost of $63 per subscriber -- not much less than the current $99 fee.  Amazon does offer Prime Music, which gives ad-free access to selected songs and curated Prime Playlists. But market leaders Spotify and Apple Music's premium services, which cost $9.99 per month or less with family plans, open up their entire music libraries to listeners without any restrictions.  There are other benefits including a Kindle Lending Library, unlimited photo storage through Prime Photo, and grocery delivery in selected areas through Amazon Fresh. But these are all benefits Prime customers received already for $99.  There may be things in the pipeline we don't know about just yet. For example, Amazon may make moves into health care, perhaps going into the pharmacy space. And when those benefits get added then perhaps Prime will be worth that extra $20. But for now, it just seems like people are paying more for the same old service.

[],,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos uses $1 billion of his ""Amazon winnings"" to fund his space company Blue Origin, he recently said in an interview.  The entrepreneur has a net worth of $127 billion and a number of personal projects to spend it on, but he says none are as important an investment as Blue Origin and the goal to put civilizations in space.  Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos spends a tiny fraction of his net worth to fund Blue Origin, the space company he started back in 2000.  For a man worth $127 billion dollars, that tiny fraction amounts to $1 billion a year, which he gets by liquidating Amazon stock, Bezos said at an Axel Springer awards event in Berlin, Germany, hosted by Business Insider US Editor in Chief Alyson Shontell.  ""The only way I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel. Blue Origin is expensive enough to be able to use that fortune,"" he joked in an interview with Axel Springer CEO Mattias D√∂pfner.  Bezos said he plans to continue funding the company through that annual tradition long into the future.  Bezos famously has a number of different projects. He's running the e-commerce giant, owns The Washington Post, and is working on turning a historical mansion in DC into a single-family home, to name a few. None of these, he said, are as relevant or as worthy of his personal money as the space company, which he called ""the most important work I'm doing.""  His personal interest in space aside, Bezos says he pursues his goal of putting people on a rocket to outer space because of what he fears could happen if we don't explore the option of living on other planets.  ""I don't want my great-grandchildren's great-grandchildren to live in a civilization of stasis,"" he said in the interview.  Humans take up a lot of energy, and that amount is growing - something Bezos refers to as ""the real energy crisis."" He sees two options: living in a state of inactivity to use up minimal energy or expanding into space.  ""The solar system can easily support a trillion humans,"" he said. ""And if we have a trillion humans we would have a thousand Einsteins, and a thousand Mozarts, and unlimited - for all practical purposes - resources from solar power and so on.""  In the short term, his billion dollars-a-year is going towards a tourism vehicle that will launch at the end of 2018 or beginning of 2019, and a large orbital vehicle that's scheduled to fly for the first time in 2020.

[],,"Jeff Bezos says Amazon is ready for a debate about regulation after Donald Trump's repeated attacks on the company.  Speaking in Germany, Bezos said Amazon has a duty to educate regulators, but will work with whatever new constraints it is given - even if they damage its business model.  The CEO warned, however, that regulation can stifle innovation.    Jeff Bezos has said that Amazon is ready for a debate about its enormous scale after coming under repeated attack from US President Donald Trump.  Trump has called out Amazon in a number of tweets in recent months, questioning its impact on the US Postal Office, the amount of tax it pays, and the potential harm it is causing other retailers.  Bezos said it is right that governments and the public want to investigate the power of huge tech companies - and he doesn't take the urge for regulation personally.  ""If you look at the big tech companies, they have gotten large enough that they are going to be inspected.  It's not personal,"" Bezos said at an event hosted by Business Insider US Editor in Chief Alyson Shontell in Germany on Tuesday, where he was awarded a prize for business innovation and social responsibility by Business Insider's parent company Axel Springer.  The Amazon CEO said policing the power of online companies is ""one of the great questions of our age"" because as the internet has reached a level of maturity over the past decade ""we haven't learned as a civilization, as a human species, how to operate it yet.""  Amazon, Bezos said, is ready to help educate regulators and will work with whatever new constraints it is given - even if they have damaging consequences for the company.  ""We have a duty, on behalf of society, to try and help educate any regulators, give them our view on this, sincerely without any cynicism or skepticism,"" he said in a conversation with Axel Springer CEO Mathias D√∂pfner.  ""So we will work with any set of regulations we are given. Ultimately, society decides that, and we will follow those rules, regardless of the impact that they have on our business. And we will find a new way, if need be, to delight customers.""  Bezos did make clear, however, that the urge to curb the power of companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google, should be balanced with the need to continue incentivising innovation in the tech industry.  ""What I would not want to see happen is you do not want to block invention and innovation. One of the unintended consequences of regulation is that it really favours the incumbents,"" he said.  ""Amazon at this point is an incumbent, so maybe I should be happy about that, but I wouldn't be. For society, you really want to see continued progress. You want to be sure regulation is incentivising innovation.""",Jeff Bezos says Amazon is ready for a debate about regulation after Donald Trump's repeated attacks on the company

Paul J. Richards/Getty Images  The guy has so many houses he could have his own season of MTV Cribs.  The 27,000-square-foot estate that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is renovating in Washington, D.C., is just one of several colossal properties he owns around the country: two Beverly Hills, California, houses, whose total purchase value adds up to more than $37 million; hundreds of thousands of acres in West Texas, where Bezos‚Äô space tourism company, Blue Origin, is based; four apartments in a building on Central Park West in New York; and several homes in the suburbs of Seattle, not far from Bill Gates.  But according to a gossipy feature in the May issue of Washingtonian, it‚Äôs in the salons and private restaurant rooms of high Washington that Bezos has found his scene. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs definitely a different Bezos from what we saw here,‚Äù Leslie Helm, editor of Seattle Business magazine, told the magazine of Bezos‚Äô low-key life in Amazon‚Äôs home city. ‚ÄúI suspect you see more of him in DC than we see of him here.‚Äù  Which goes some way toward explaining his purchase, in October 2016, of two adjacent Georgian mansions in the Kalorama neighborhood, which is also home to the Obamas and Javanka. Together, the houses include 11 bedrooms and three kitchens‚Äîperfect for America‚Äôs richest man, who loves making breakfast. The two houses have enough doors for the Amazon CEO to use a new door every 48 hours all year long; they have enough toilets to deliver a package in a different bathroom nearly every day of the month.  To restore the interiors to early 20th-century domestic glory, Bezos hired the architecture firm Barnes Vanze. Washingtonian got the renovation blueprints through a Freedom of Information Act request.  They reveal the billionaire‚Äôs plans to use the larger of the two mansions, which features a two-level ballroom, as a party house, complete with staff bedrooms, offices, bathrooms with stalls, and easy access to a sumptuous back garden. The details are historically informed and not particularly interesting; wood, limestone, glass, and wrought iron will make the place shine like it‚Äôs 1914 again.  The architecture may be more interesting from another angle. As Richard Florida observed in September, CEO residence is a major indicator of corporate relocations. That the Kalorama mansion is turning into the most opulent of Bezos‚Äô second homes might be a clue that Amazon‚Äôs second headquarters is heading for the Beltway.  And while the Pope and Wood houses (named for their architects, John Russell Pope of Jefferson Memorial fame and Waddy Wood, who designed the nearby Woodrow Wilson house) were most recently the Textile Museum, the Bezos complex epitomizes a hot trend in historic urban neighborhoods: the consolidation of separate apartments and homes into ever-larger mansions whose size is sometimes obscured by obsolete or misleading architectural signaling.

A ballroom, five staircases, two elevators, a walk-in wine room and a whiskey cellar are just some of the mansion's amenities.  The estate is comprised of two historic structures built in the 1900s, one of which will serve as the Bezos' living quarters and the other as an entertainment space.  Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has some pretty grand ideas in store for his Washington D.C. mansion, if these floor plans are any indication.

The estate sits in close proximity to the Obama family's $5.3 million home, and Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner live down the street.  According to The Washingtonian, the four-story Pope house will be the Bezos family's living quarters, with the Wood house reserved as the CEO's socializing and entertainment hub in the capitol city. The two structures are connected by a walkway.  A ballroom, a whiskey cellar, a walk-in wine room, five staircases, two elevators, multiple bathrooms (there are 10 in the Pope house alone) and a solarium (also known as a sun room), are just some of the extravagant features of this Bezos estate.  Bezos paid $23 million for the premises in 2016, and reportedly spent $12 million into renovation on the 27,000-square-foot property last year, for a grand total of $35 million on the project thus far.

"['Jason Roberson', 'Rex Curry']",2018-04-23 00:00:00,"Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, and one of the nation's most eligible relocation seekers, visited Dallas Friday evening to shed light on his business success, but not where he plans to build his coveted second headquarters.  The George W. Bush Presidential Center and Southern Methodist University co-hosted Bezos' interview, which lasted 51 minutes inside of SMU's Moody Coliseum.  ""Jeff, welcome to Dallas. I'm excited that you can see what a city that really wants you here looks like. Right, guys?"" said Kenneth Hersh, Bush Center CEO, eliciting roaring applause from a packed coliseum. ""I left 30 seconds here, just in case there was a little real estate announcement you wanted to make.""  Bezos laughed it off, and never circled back to the topic.  What he did emphasize, however, was a need for entrepreneurs to be daring, fight through discomfort, relish in naysayers' lack of vision and move away from present paradigms.  Read more from the Dallas Business Journal:  Chef and author to share business know-how in Dallas  See DFW's largest small business sales during Q1  Connecting: Exit stage left  Weathering early struggles  Bezos started Amazon in 1995. Back then, he'd often drive packages to the post office himself.  ""I knew the UPS guy so well that he would even let me in five minutes after closing,"" Bezos said. ""I hoped one day we'd be able to afford a forklift. We were so inefficient with our operations and logistics that ‚Ä¶ we were packing on the floor, on our hands and knees.  ""I said to one of the software engineers, who was packing alongside me, 'You know what we should do? We should get knee pads.' He looked at me like I was the dumbest guy he'd ever seen in his life and said, 'Jeff, we should get packing tables.' The next day I bought packing tables, and it doubled productivity.""  Bezos peppered the conversation with similar vignettes of early struggles to underline a point of challenging conventional thinking.  He took Amazon public in 1997, issuing stock at $1.50 per share. In 1998, revenue was $600 million, and he lost $125 million, but stock had jumped to $55 a share.  He doubled down. Sales went up three-fold. He lost hundreds of millions more, but stock went up to $76 by December 1999.  The market indicated Amazon ‚Äî and every other dot.com enterprise ‚Äî was doing great, even though it was in the red, taking on roughly $2 billion in debt from 1999 to 2001. Despite the debt, Amazon kept doubling sales. During the interview, Bezos indicated that his even-keeled perspective on his company's success positioned Amazon to survive where other dot.com startups failed.  ""I liked our business, and I liked the fundamentals of our business, but I also knew that the stock price was disconnected from what we were doing on a day-to-day basis,"" he said. ""I told the staff, when the stock is up 30 percent in a month, don't feel 30 percent smarter. Because when it's down 30 percent in a month, you're going to have to feel 30 percent dumber, and it's not going to feel as good.""  Laying that mental ground work was helpful, because by 2000 Amazon's stock went down to $6 per share. On a split-adjusted basis, it was below $1 per share.  He wasn't disheartened. Bezos said he kept close tabs on Amazon's internal metrics, such as the number of customers, the company's fixed costs and positive contribution margin.  ""I just knew it was a fixed-cost business, and as soon as we reached a sufficient scale, we would have a good business,"" Bezos said.  Tenants of success  It's well documented that he was right. Amazon's stock on Friday closed at $1,527.49 per share, and this year Bezos' net worth is around $119 billion.  During his sit-down interview on stage, he dovetailed Amazon's triumph-over-adversity talking points with his own tenants for business success.",Here's what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said when he visited Dallas
[],,"Jeff Bezos, who bought the Washington Post in 2013, was once wary of wading into the Washington, DC limelight.  However, the Amazon CEO now embraces DC and sees himself as the successor to former Washington Post publisher Kay Graham, according to the Washingtonian.  Insiders who spoke to the magazine point to the Jason Rezaian incident as the turning point.  Bezos' embrace of DC life could have implications for where Amazon's second headquarters eventually lands, but by how much is anyone's guess.  Jeff Bezos was once wary of Washington, DC.  The Amazon CEO, who bought the Washington Post in 2013, didn't see himself as a fixture in the city.  ""At the beginning, he was more reticent about being in Washington, about being involved in these kinds of things, and wasn't really that interested in injecting himself in it,"" one acquaintance of Bezos told Washingtonian for part of a profile on Bezos's DC life  In fact, Bezos needed a to be convinced by former and famous Post reporter Bob Woodward, who emailed him, to go to former Post editor Ben Bradlee's funeral in 2014, the magazine reported.  Since then, however, his thinking has shifted. The biggest incident that changed his mind happened in 2016, when Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post journalist reporting in Iran, was taken prisoner and convicted of espionage. After being held in the country for 18 months, he was released.  Bezos and his personal jet flew to an American military base in Germany to pick up Rezaian. The cabin was decorated with #freejason streamers. He instructed his pilot to take Rezaian and his wife anywhere in the world.  ""The Jason Rezaian experience really was an inflection point for him,""an acquaintance told the Washingtonian.  Bezos was treated to a round of applause when he arrived back at Post headquarters.  27,000-square-foot mansion in the well-heeled Kalorama section.  Since then, Bezos has upped the amount of time he spends in DC. He still lives most of the time in Seattle, but flies to DC often. In 2016, he bought the largest home in the city for $26 million dollars - a  According to the blueprints obtained by Washingtonian in a Freedom of Information Act request, half the home is for personal use and the other half is in the process of being turned into a haven for entertaining, with landscaped grounds, and a large ballroom, and a commercial style bathroom with six stalls.  ""What he's going to do is revive the legacy of Kay Graham and her great socializing - bringing smart, interesting people together in a social context,"" Jean Case, a friend of Bezos since the 1990s, told the Washingtonian.  Another friend told the magazine that he is now attracted to DC ""like a moth to light.""  Will Bezos digging his heels into DC provide any kind of glimpse at where Amazon's HQ2 may land? Perhaps, but maybe not.  According to Washingtonian, Bezos rarely steps into Amazon's DC office, the site of its lobbying arm, instead busying himself with work related to the Post or his rocket venture, Blue Origin.  Still, a second headquarters could give Bezos another big reason to visit the city he's grown accustomed to. Throwing in the $5 billion investment and 50,000 new workers HQ2 promises to bring could either give Bezos more levers to pull, or complicate his social endeavors.",One event changed how Jeff Bezos sees DC - and it could have implications for where Amazon's second headquarters will land
[],,"Audible CEO Don Katz founded the digital audiobook company in 1995, launched with one of the world's first digital audio players.  The company made it through the late 1990s tech bubble and the death of a CEO Katz hired.  Katz sold Audible to Amazon in 2008 for $300 million, keeping it largely independent and retaining his role as CEO.  He shared what he learned from switching careers so late, and why he bonded with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.  Don Katz sounds more like a college English professor than a tech CEO. He's obsessed with literature and writing.  And it's why he started Audible, the audiobook company owned by Amazon, in 1995.  ""It was all about the stories, and it was all about the voice of the stories,"" Katz said on Business Insider's podcast, ""Success! How I Did It."" ""I was always an ear-driven writer, and I kind of heard things when I read it.""  Katz has been running a tech company for over a decade, and he got his master's in economics in the '70s. But storytelling is his passion above all else.  He was one of the earliest writers for Rolling Stone, where he covered terrorism and revolutions around the world.  He had a long career as a writer. But in his 40s, he decided to take a giant leap into another direction. It all started with a fanny pack (or belly pack, as he calls it).  Listen to the full episode here:  Subscribe to ""Success! How I Did It"" on Apple Podcasts, Google Play, or your favorite podcast app. Check out previous episodes with:  The following transcript has been edited for clarity.  I loved listening to well-composed, artfully performed words when I jogged in Riverside Park. I would listen in the old-school way, which was to have tapes in my belly pack. I always talked about the fact that they were profoundly inefficient. They froze in the winter. They would bake in the dashboard in the summer. There's nothing worse when you're aerobically taxed than trying to futz with them and change them out in your Walkman, an ancient device. There was no question that I realized that there was an element of the standing business of audiobooks that was not very efficient. There are many other strains of why Audible exists, and clearly that one relates to the fact that when we did figure out the technology - and this was 1994 and 1995 - that included how to download a file, how to secure that file.  Richard Feloni: Like MP3 files.  Katz: Exactly, but this was before the term was used. As with most things we've done. (We had programming five years before a ""podcast"" was named.) To think that we survived - because usually you don't get to be six or seven years before market and survive - is one of the great mysteries.  Feloni: In the '90s.  Katz: Yeah, this was the mid-'90s, and I realized, ""We have to make it so I can get this into my belly pack."" And that led to the invention of the first solid state digital audio device, and that's why, in 1994, I was walking around trying to convince smart people I knew that there was this future of the best of civilization packed in these devices in our pocket. Which at the time was - to say that people thought I was crazy and didn't know what I was talking about was a huge understatement. When you think of how early we came out, five years before the iPod, it's still stunning that we survived those early days.  Feloni: Well, how'd you get the resources to make this device in the first place?  Katz: This was a case of just pretty classic venture capital working to support innovation, or as we have as a tenet at Audible, inventing before the customer asks. We share that with Amazon, and it is very different than the business school concept of solving the problem of a customer. When we had this concept, I wrote a 120-page business plan.  Feloni: Like a good author would!  Exactly. The joke there being that I showed it to a business person I knew was a real great business leader, and she said to me, ""Where are the bullet points?"" I memorably said, ""What's a bullet point?""  Feloni: It was like basically a novel.  Katz: I was a prose writer, and so I write this plan. What I did is I used my journalism to become ever more expert on digital technology.  A hotshot young journalist traveling the world  Feloni: How long had you been a journalist at this point?  Katz: Well, I put my figurative pen down in 1995, and that was 20 years to the day that I made my living as an author and a writer. It was quite a long run. I was a writer in the sense of the old Rolling Stone voice. I was one of the original Rolling Stone writers, and we did non-fiction storytelling that was true. This kind of narrative non-fiction storytelling that we had developed there was based on novelistic recreation of the truth at a time when other outlets were not necessarily telling the truth about either civil rights, or the Vietnam War and the like.  Feloni: Can you tell us a little bit more about those early days at Rolling Stone?  Katz: I had one of these weirdly precocious starts to a career. I was a student at the London School of Economics and I had just finished my masters. My roommate from Chicago was a rock writer, and she was always a rock and roll fan. I went out for dinner with her one night, and I'm sitting next to this guy who says he's from Rolling Stone. I tell him what I'm doing, and he basically says, ""You know, you should write a letter to this guy, Jann Wenner, and you've got such good access to what's going on in Europe. You should just do some storytelling, if you like writing."" I told him I was an English major before I went to economic school.  Long story short, I get a letter from the magazine when Francisco Franco, the dictator of Spain, starts to die. I'm asked to go to Spain and cover the death. In that period, I learned to be a journalist because it was the last hurrah of all the World War II correspondents. And one way or another, I write a 5,000 or 6,000-word story, and it proceeds to come out on the front page of Rolling Stone, and with almost no edits. It's called ""Dispatch from the Valley of the Fallen."" I went into the head of the London School of Economics and said, ""I'm out of here.""  I proceeded to become a freelance writer who worked mostly for Rolling Stone, but I avoided the editors whenever they would come to London. Because I looked like I was about 11 when I was 23. It was just an amazing thing to be part of the first 10 years. I would do crazy things: I covered the Ethiopian revolution - I was the only American on the ground; I ran around with the guys who became the Red Brigade in Italy; I covered the Northern Ireland crisis when there was shooting. I think I was probably thinking that if I almost got killed, that they'd publish me.  Just a kid going into war zones.  Katz: Rolling Stone for my generation was a kind of literary Bible. It was like a dream to be able to write for them. Then they consolidated from San Francisco to New York, and I was brought back to be a foreign correspondent and feature writer. It was just an amazing couple of years. In many ways my current life is not that far unconnected. I often say that Audible is precisely the business a professional writer would make if they were interested in the business and organizational underpinnings of how they made a living. It is a fantastic background. I wouldn't trade those 20 years as a writer for anything.  From writer to inventor  Feloni: When did you decide to go from journalism to being an inventor?  Katz: My whole thing was: ""What do these things mean, as opposed to what they do?"" The Rolling Stone idea was you'd get close to, as I did, to terrorists, or to people throughout the '70s who were fighting wars of liberation, willing to die for a cause. What was it like to have that happen? Then when I wrote books about business - and I wrote a book about Sears, a 600-page tome; I wrote a book about Nike. I asked: What do these companies mean to all the constituents around them and to the culture in general?  I think that allowed Audible to grow up as a company that was really consistent about opening up opportunities to consumers in particular. This weirdness of customer centricity is what I bonded with Jeff Bezos on, where you really are working backwards from a different idea. How can you actually import something profound to people, because of the power of an organization, as opposed to measuring yourself in dollars and cents or just permutations on a theme?  We went at it saying there's a media type that doesn't exist in America for all sorts of artificial reasons, and that is the spoken word. This civilization, this American culture, and all of our literature is based on an oral and vernacular tradition.  Feloni: It was all about the stories for you.  Katz: It was all about the stories, and it was all about the voice of the stories. I was always an ear-driven writer, and I heard things when I read.  Feloni: It wasn't as big a leap as it might have been.  It wasn't. But I knew that the general snobbery around the idea of recording a book came from this idea that textual culture was somehow morally and intellectually superior. I never bought it. The reason I never bought it was my mentor in college was Ralph Ellison , the great American writer, and Ralph was an unbelievably deep student of the vernacular tradition. I read a lot of the studies, from the 1920s in particular, about how American literature became this function of oral culture. Of course, historically, there was no written culture. From the ancient Greeks through the end of St. Augustine, all found writing intellectually inferior, because it would atrophy memory and the ability to think.  Audible came into existence for a lot of different reasons, but I was a pretty rare literary writer who actually thought the sound of literature had the same integrity as the look of it.  Feloni: Why wait 20 years into your career?  Katz: I'm still more the student and the celebrator of advanced technology than I am the creator of it. I often say that being an inquisitive journalist is probably one of the best backgrounds to start a company, because if you're good as a reporter, you actually know you don't know enough. You have to then, in some basically moral level of honesty, go out and find the truth, and you have to supplement it by getting people to trust you, tell you the realities of things. I think that it's a fantastic way to be honest about what you don't know.  Now that I'm a very active angel investor and started a venture fund, I see that there is an instinct with particularly pure tech younger entrepreneurs, that they can do it all, and it's just not true, and I think you do actually have to have this fearless inventory of what you just don't know. Otherwise, you can't write the truth.  You and your roommate, you're able to complement each other's skill sets, and you have this great idea. When did you decide that this could actually become a company, and when did you make that leap?  Katz: It was literally us just riffing on an idea, which sounded like a business idea, with all the rationalization of cost and a focus on more consumer choice. The weird thing was that Ed Lau, who's one of my best friends to this day, knew how to do spreadsheets, unlike me. The business plan began to really look like a business plan.  Feloni: It went from a novel to an actual business plan.  Katz: It did, and very quickly. I got a lot of under-employed geniuses out of Bell Labs to build from whole cloth all of the code. You don't think about how many things you needed to invent in that day, to say nothing of designing the hardware and the like.  It had a lot of funny moments to it - I remember $14,000 on my credit card. As a working writer with a house and kids, it was a stress point. I took an 85% year-over-year pay cut between my last year as a writer and my first year as an entrepreneur.  Feloni: What did your family think of that?  Katz: My wife has always supported me working without a net. You can't do this stuff without that kind of home support.  The funny thing about the patent I got was that it was for a solid state cassette. It was shaped like an old school cassette. The idea was you loaded up off the phone lines. You stuck it in the tape bed in your car, and that proceeded to turn electro-mechanical controls into digital controls. You look back and think, well the tape bed was going out of existence, and so it was one of those kind of like ""good idea at the time things."" In our many cases of Audible-ready devices, they are all the museum pieces at Audible headquarters. The original sits there as the first thing we thought of.  Surviving the tech bubble and a tragedy  Feloni: What was it like trying to survive in the early years?  We really took off in 2003, and it was '95 we started the company. Usually you don't get more than months, let alone years.  We did a lot of smart things to survive, and I think part of it was I had watched business as a student. In many ways I was more of a student of larger organizations than I was a starter of smaller companies. I knew enough to know that I was not going to give our IPO money, from when we went public in the summer of 1999, to either Yahoo or AOL - which almost everyone did at that point. Because as soon as the bubble broke in April of 2000, they had no money. We kept our money.  We partnered precociously with big companies, which was one of our distinctive angles, to succeed by partnering with the competition. We did end up having big partners, like Microsoft and Bertelsmann, who were there to back us up during tough times. All the tech companies were in a dark place for much of 2000 until probably the middle of 2003. The decimation, I've heard, is on the order of 1,500 publicly traded internet companies down to 140 by the end.  Feloni: It was devastating. To step back to day one, what was it like going from journalist to the CEO of a team of these very talented people you had assembled?  Katz: The best thing for me was I wasn't much of a lone wolf. The kind of job I had before, I would go off on these long features or books that would take me several years. I learned a lot from so many people, but ultimately I'd come back and I would have to be in a room writing. It was like me and the ideas.  But I realized at various points in my life, notably raising a whole lot of money to rebuild a library in my home town, that I was pretty good at galvanizing teams around ideas and visions, and creating missions that you could build consensus around. I just thought, how great would it be to have colleagues? One of the biggest changes was just being together. I remember we were at a retreat in 1996 for all 11 of us or whatever. We go off and everybody goes around the room to say what's exciting about this to them. The office manager spoke and she said, ""Well, the amazing thing for me is that my boss never worked in an office before."" I said, ""Well, there was an office. There was just no one else there."" I think that's part of it, is just the camaraderie was edifying. To this day, I think I'm really one of those people who thinks that Audible had lots of founders.  Feloni: In a couple years then you had brought in an external CEO, right?  Yeah, I did. I mean, you know, I was easy about whether I was a chairman or the driving presence, or the CEO. There was a point where just the tech build, particularly being in the hardware business, was so specific that I recruited a great guy to just be CEO for the tech development capacity he had. He unfortunately died on a basketball court at 39 years old, of an aneurysm. I often said that, of those of us around, then the 30 some of us, it totally steeled I think people to some of the external realities of life. I think it actually toughened people up. I realized I was the only one in the company who had ever really had tragic sudden death kinds of loss in their life. A grief counselor came in and everything, but it was painful passage. The guy's name was Andy Huffman. He was a great, great guy.  I took back over, and then there was another point where there was briefly another CEO who came out of big media, and that was another era for the early internet 1.0 era, where it became very sexy to work at companies like Audible. Another very nice guy came in, but that didn't keep, and I was CEO again. I've been there. I'm one of those strange animals in that I'm a founder still there after all this time.  Meeting Jeff Bezos  Feloni: When did you and Jeff Bezos have your first conversation?  Katz: The first conversation we had probably in 2006, and then we consummated the marriage in 2008. It was a lot of discussion, but we were always interacting. I'd go to Seattle, I would pitch digital ideas. He and his team were not ready for digital going way back, and he was not necessarily wrong, because it was difficult to get a lot of traction in digital media before a lot of infrastructure was there. We had a big part of it, and we did actually empower the real revenue and the real content of a lot of the devices in that day.  What happened was that, when the bubble blew out, we decided to just double down on serving customers in the best possible way, and that meant we developed all kinds of SDKs and firmware that would be built into the mp3 players, so that they natively worked with Audible. That's what happened with the iPod. We had chips that were made that were Audible compatible. And then we created a membership program, which again was not normal. Most people thought it was just going to be you sold a book, it was a la carte. We created a habituation system that between the quality of the service and the quality of the customer care, and the quality of the content going up and up and up. And then became the largest maker of spoken word audio, as well as the largest seller. It ended up being that what we were doing is creating these lifelong loyalists. In normal retail you can have loyalty, but it's not something people do every day, like they do with Audible.  Feloni: Could you tell me what the conversation was like with Bezos when you realized that this would be a good partnership?  Katz: I mean, I forget who came up with the idea first or second, but we mainly would get, when we got together it was just to trade ideas, which was always what I did from the time I met him in the mid '90s. Which was just literally, what do you think about this and what are you thinking about this? It always was a great way to just interact when we saw each other. We also kind of shared this whole idea that he's very specific on, which is a missionaries and mercenaries. He pretty much divides the world between mercenaries, or those people who sell the company before it's anything, changed jobs all the time, they're in it for them, they're really good at review time, but they don't actually add value. You know, it's a pretty negative critique, but let's face it, there's a lot of people who see the world that way and often go into businesses where you are measuring things in things like money. Then there's these missionaries, who just get hooked on an idea, and just can't let it go. They subordinate the noise to that stuff. I don't necessarily, I see the gray area a lot, but those are the kinds of things we always talked about that made me admire him from the beginning.  Feloni: Amazon bought your company for $300 million in 2008, and you and Bezos had established this personal connection, so it just felt right at that point, and it seemed like this is what could take Audible to the next step?  Katz: Yeah. I mean, there were negotiations, and we were a public company, so fiduciarily we talked to other companies and the like, which is what you do. It's part of the rules and the law and the shareholder responsibility. But it was pretty easy, because a lot of the people that I still work with there I had known since 2000, because that's when we sold 5% of Audible to Jeff. The first thing we did after acquisition was had, oh, 150 engineers working on transferring our massive code base over to be compatible with Amazon's. Then you could use your Amazon ID to be a member and that opened up access to the greatest agglomeration of consumers probably in the history of commerce, which would be Amazon, to Audible. That whole idea of, how high we could go started happening fairly quickly after acquisition.  Tying Audible's success to Newark's  Feloni: Why did you move Audible to Newark in 2007?  Katz: That was really part of this whole idea of, what does a company mean in ways that can transcend what it does? We knew we wanted to move to a place that these amazing number of actors we were now employing could get to more easily, and Newark is only 17 or 18 minutes from Penn Station, one of its great advantages in its massive comeback. I was always interested in urban transformation, and you saw how you could teach a kid out of poverty through the amazing dedication of these teachers and the like. I was very focused on that, and I just got to know Newark that way. We just wanted to move in and start to define the culture through these other things, like embracing as a customer set people without socioeconomic privilege, just because it seemed like the right thing to do.  First thing we did is we just made a rule that all the nepotistic hiring of the kids of my friends and things like that was going to end, because you had to be a kid from Newark to be a paid intern at Audible. That immediately changed the culture for better. These amazing kids came into our world. Now we've got, we're the biggest employer of actors in the New York area. The kids are there. Rocket scientist level of technologists, alongside English majors turned into business people. It becomes this really rich place to work, and even so much better for being in Newark.  Then I began to get pulled into the idea of being the chairman of the Economic Development Corporation. You began to see all sorts of ways to be disruptively progressive about how to create growth and change. That led to things like the founding of Newark Venture Partners, which is a old school venture fund that's really taking off. It's right in our building because if you do the more advanced research, you see that tech actually is a key to urban transformation. You see it in other cities, because it actually generates massive numbers of jobs at all levels for every tech job or coding job.  Feloni: How did you avoid seeming like an outsider parachuting in? Kind of being like, ""I know what's good for you, and just follow what we do.""  Katz: You know, well one thing is you just have to be much more schooled on history than frankly a lot of college graduates who want to do good are. Just to understand that will cow some level of appearing to be patronizing. You can't change the color of your skin, but you can just do the right thing, and I found amazing allies from all political walks of life. Partly, too, it's just because we kind of put our money where our mouth is. We'd make sure the school system has Audible service, like we've done this year. We do things like subsidize our employees living in the city. Just trying to get other corporations to get with it.  Feloni: What's next for Audible?  Katz: I think Audible's just going to keep getting weirdly bigger at massive scale, which is not easy to manage. There's not many companies that have achieved high growth and high scale, and it's, my kids would call it a first world problem. Not so sure how politically correct that is, but it is. I see the original mission, in some ways, it's beyond my kind of dream for it. But the big thing for us now is that we're inviting the professional creative class to write and perform to this very distinctive aesthetic, and going way beyond audio books, as we have been from the beginning, with Robin Williams, Ricky Gervais, people like that worked for us five years before the word podcast was in the lexicon.  Now it's really been fascinating, we opened a whole new theater fund to enfranchise playwrights who are writing one and two-voice productions. The dream there is to potentially become the electronic analog to theater. Theater could be well supported, but not necessarily from the altruism point of view, from the arts point of view there's just so much talent. An amazing number of young playwrights who are, I would say, underemployed. We're looking at that class and everything.  You just consistently see new opportunities. Again, I'm sort of, how high can we go? It's the fun for me after all these years.  How to have a productive midlife crisis  Feloni: What advice would you give to someone who maybe they were 20 years into their career, as you were, who's considering a big change, or starting their own business?  Katz: Well, my wife would say that it's better to have a nontoxic midlife crisis like I did, rather than some of the other things people get up to when they hit the middle of their lives. I would recommend trying to start a business, rather than other things people get up to. It's a little less family toxic.  I think that the question is, can you take what you probably get to know a little bit more, because you've accumulated more experience, and then be as inventive as somebody younger who has this monolithic belief in a new idea and stuff? If you've got that kind of ability to persevere, but you have to be one of these relentless people.

You have to define your vision around the right kind of metrics, because you need to have a vision of what you're going to measure in the early days. Because if you don't, the people you get the money from will tell you how to measure, and you won't necessarily want that until it's the right time.  Feloni: Well, thank you so much, Don.

[],,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos still personally reads customer complaint emails sent to him, even though he doesn't reply to many of them, he said during an on-stage interview on Friday.  Often, he'll forward those emails on to the executives in charge with a single character: a question mark.  The manager who receives the email is then on the hook to drop everything, research the situation, and write a well-crafted response.    Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has a notorious habit of sending his executives an email which has a single character: a question mark.  When the executive gets an email from Bezos that simply says ""?"" they know that Bezos is concerned about something because a customer complained, Bezos explained during an on-stage interview at the George Bush Presidential Center on Friday.  ""I still have an email address customers can write to,"" Bezos explained. Although he doesn't typically answer those emails himself, he does read them.  ""I see most of those emails. I see them and I forward them to the executives in charge of the area with a question mark. It's shorthand [for] can you look into this? Why is this happening?,"" Bezos said.  Getting such an email is a pretty common thing at Amazon, and it's also big deal. The executive, in turn, will often foward it along to the manager in charge of the area who will view the email with a sinking heart, one of them recently told us.  That's because the manager is then on the hook to drop everything, investigate and get back with an answer. Sometimes that means a lot of research over nights and weekends, the Amazon manager recently told us.  But Bezos views that email address, jeff@amazon.com, as a way to stay close to customers, which can otherwise be hard to do as an executive, who is far removed from day-to-day customer service and sees the company mostly through data and reports.  ""We have tons of metrics,"" Bezos explained on stage. ""When you are shipping billions of packages a year, you need good data and metrics: are you delivering on time? Delivering on time to every city? To apartment complexes? ... Whether the packages have too much air in them, wasteful packaging.""  So those customer complaints gives him front-line insights. If all of his data say one thing and a few customers say something else, he believes the customers.  ""The thing I have noticed is when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right. There's something wrong with the way you are measuring it,"" he explained.  This is one of the ways Bezos expresses what he calls one of Amazon's most important values: customer obsession.  ""We talk about it, customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession,"" he said. Often companies say they are focused on customers but they really spend most of their energy reacting to and talking about competitors.  ""If your whole culture is competitor-obsessed, it's hard to stay motivated if you are out in front. Whereas customers are also unsatisfied, always discontent, always want more. So no matter how far in front you get in front of competitors, you are still behind your customers. They are always pulling you along,"" he said.","Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos explains his famous one-character emails, known to strike fear in manager's hearts"
[],,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos explained during an on-stage interview on Friday the strange meetings Amazon holds.  Every meeting requires a well-crafted six-page memo which the whole room sits and reads at the start of the meeting.  Bezos banned PowerPoint years ago and explained why the memo-driven meeting is far superior.  If you go to work as an executive at Amazon, no matter what your expertise, you will be required to become a good writer, and a good reader, in order to lead the meetings necessary to do your job.  And Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos fully admits that this will likely be 'weird,' he explained during an on-stage interview at the George Bush Presidential Center on Friday.  ""No PowerPoints are used inside Amazon,"" he said. ""When we hire a new executive from outside [we warn], this is the weirdest meeting culture you ever encounter.""  He explained, ""For every meeting, someone from the meeting has prepared a six-page, narratively structured memo that has real sentences and topic sentences and verbs. It's not just bullet points. It's supposed to create the context for the discussion we're about to have.""  Everyone then sits and reads the memo silently, which often takes a good half-hour. And then they discuss the memo.  These meetings are ""so much better than the typical PowerPoint presentation for so many reasons,"" he said. He didn't go into the reasons why on stage, but he had discussed his views on memo-driven meetings in his recently published annual letter to shareholders. (And he has, in years past, explained his ban on PowerPoint.)  In the letter, he explained that writing a brilliant, long memo requires the writer to understand the subject well. It also requires the writer to ""improve results through the simple act of teaching scope."" By that he means doing a great job requires effort, not speed. ""A great memo probably should take a week or more"" to write, he said in the letter.  On stage on Friday, Bezos explained that since it takes so much time to create a great memo, he uses a foolproof method to ensure everyone reads it.  ""We read [the memos] in the room. Just like high school kids, executives will bluff their way through the meeting as if they've read the memo. So you have to carve out time so everyone has actually read the memo - they are not just pretending,"" he said.  Ultimately ""a brilliant and thoughtful"" memo will ""set up the meeting for high-quality discussion,"" he explained.  There might be another reason for this ""weird"" meeting culture. Bezos is a book lover who started Amazon as an online book store. Reading is in the company's DNA.",Jeff Bezos admits Amazon has 'the weirdest meeting culture you will ever encounter'
[],,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos shared his ideas what makes for an amazing memo in his annual letter to shareholders.  At Amazon, memos must be narrative in structure and six pages in length.  Bezos said he's always looking for memos that have the ""clarity of angels singing.""    Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has some tips on crafting the perfect memo, which he broke down in his annual letter to shareholders.  At the online retail giant, memos must be six pages and ""narratively-structured."" These memos never contain individual authors' names - only the name of the team.  Bezos said that, at the start of meetings, teams will silently read through memos as part of a ""study hall.""  ""Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely,"" he wrote. ""Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum.""  The rules on memos aren't the only workplace practices that Amazon holds employees to. PowerPoint and other slide show presentations - along with most overly large meetings - are banned at the company.  But what's the key difference between a heavenly memo and an infernal one in the Amazon CEO's mind?  The answer is simple: Time.  Bezos wrote that you just can't crank out a great memo in a day. In fact, he suggested that some might require a week to get right.  ""The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind,"" he wrote.  Bezos added that giving yourself enough time eclipses actual writing skills when it comes to memos.  ""The football coach doesn't need to be able to throw, and a film director doesn't need to be able to act,"" he wrote. ""But they both do need to recognize high standards for those things and teach realistic expectations on scope.""",Jeff Bezos shared his strategy for crafting the perfect memo - and he said they should take days to write
[],,"During an executive meeting, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos once called the VP of Customer Service out for extended hold times, according to an excerpt from Brad Stone's ""The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon.""  After VP Bill Price asserted that customers were waiting on the phones for less than a minute, Bezos tested it out for himself and grew increasingly angry as the minutes ramped up.  About 30 executives watched as Bezos put his stance on customer experience on display.    Jeff Bezos takes customer service seriously.  That's the lesson former Global VP of Customer Service Bill Price learned during a meeting of 30 Amazon executives years ago, according to an excerpt from Brad Stone's ""The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon.""  When Bezos asked Price how long the telephone support hold times were as sales were picking up during the holiday season , Price responded without any proof that they were less than a minute, so Bezos set out to fact check him  ""Really?"" he said. ""Let's see.""  Bezos dialed Amazon's 800 number on the room's speakerphone, and all 30 executives waited out many brutal minutes of cheerful hold music. Bezos grew angrier, Price fumbled with his phone, and the others fidgeted until finally a representative answered and the CEO said ""I'm just calling to check,"" and slammed the phone down.  It was around four and a half minutes before anyone responded, according to multiple people at the meeting who relayed the details to Stone, but ""the wait seemed interminable.""  The nature of the meeting alone should have clued Price off: It was a daily occurrence during the holiday season, held for the sole purpose of reviewing company and customer issues, and it was called ""the war room."" This was the very beginning of one of those meetings, and towards the end of Price's career - the VP apparently resigned less than a year later.

[],,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was a smart and enterprising kid, as Brad Stone writes in his 2013 book ""The Everything Store.""  In sixth grade, he practiced statistical analysis by designing a survey so students could rate the teachers.  Smart kids are more likely to hold leadership positions as adults, according to research. But it's still possible for kids who struggle academically to become successful.    Before Jeff Bezos was Jeff Bezos, he was ""Tim.""  As Brad Stone wrote in his 2013 bestseller, ""The Everything Store,"" that was Bezos' pseudonym in the book ""Turning on Bright Minds,"" which explored a gifted-education program in Texas where Bezos was a student.  Bezos' teachers told the book's author, Julie Ray, that he was ""not particularly gifted in leadership."" Yet Bezos demonstrated his precociousness in other ways, like when he designed a survey to rate the sixth-grade teachers at his school, in order to practice statistical analysis for math class.  Ray wrote that the survey was, according to Bezos, designed to evaluate instructors on ""how they teach, not as a popularity contest."" When Ray visited the school, Bezos had distributed the survey to classmates and was now graphing the teachers' relative performance.  Stone pulls out other telling tidbits from Ray's book. Bezos was competitive - he was trying to keep up with a classmate who claimed she read 12 books a week - and enterprising - he was creating a more affordable version of a contraption he'd seen in a store that created an illusion of an endless tunnel.  Yep. Sounds like the Bezos we know.  Smart kids are more likely to become leaders as adults  The fact that Bezos was such a remarkable kid also fits with current research on the predictors of success in adulthood.  One small study, conducted by researchers at Vanderbilt University, found that 320 students who had scored above the 1-in-10,000 level on the SAT before age 13 held more prestigious jobs at more prestigious companies by age 38 than the rest of the population on average.  Another study , from researchers at Stirling University in the UK and University College Dublin, looked at a sample of 17,000 people and found that 10- and 11-year-old kids who demonstrated high cognitive ability were more likely to hold leadership positions as adults. (So much for Bezos' teachers' insistence that he didn't have leadership potential.)  Bill Gates, the former CEO of Microsoft, was similarly talented as a pre-teen. The Wall Street Journal reported that he read the entire World Book Encyclopedia series at a young age. By age 11, Gates' father told The Journal, Gates began asking his parents about topics like international affairs and business.  The moral of the story isn't that if you weren't such an impressive kid, you'll never achieve Bezos- or Gates-style success. You might! There are plenty of successful people who struggled academically or otherwise as children. Likewise, just because you're a smart kid or teenager doesn't necessarily mean you'll go onto become a CEO.  Still, it's worth noting this pattern.  It's also important to remember that Bezos was enrolled in a gifted and talented program when Ray met him. If teachers hadn't recognized his potential and he'd stayed with his ""average"" peers, he might never have blossomed into one of the most powerful people in the world.",12-year-old Jeff Bezos designed a survey to rate his middle-school teachers

""It's human nature.""  And because of that, companies cannot ""rest on [their] laurels in this world.""  Despite Amazon's immense success, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos isn't about to get complacent.  And there's a good reason for that. Although Amazon has scored highly in recent studies of customer feedback, he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders, customers' demands increase all the time.  ""One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent,"" Bezos wrote. ""Their expectations are never static - they go up. It's human nature.""  Bezos goes on to explain that human progress from hunter-gatherer days was not made by ""being satisfied.""  ""People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterday's 'wow' quickly becomes today's 'ordinary.'"" he writes.  Bezos notes that as technology improves, customers are demanding more - and more quickly - than ever before. That means that companies and organizations that do not rapidly adapt to meet these challenges could quickly get dropped from customers' minds.  ""You cannot rest on your laurels in this world,"" Bezos says. ""Customers won't have it.""  Bezos cites having ""high standards"" as a big part of staying ahead of customer expectations.  ""We've had some successes over the years in our quest to meet the high expectations of customers,"" Bezos wrote. ""We've also had billions of dollars' worth of failures along the way.""  One of those successes is Amazon Prime. Bezos shared in the letter that Prime now has more than 100 million subscribers globally. This is the first time that Amazon has revealed just how many people pay for Prime. Estimates from analysts pegged it at about 90 million as recently as last year.  Bezos went on to explain how much Prime has expanded since it was founded 13 years ago. The membership now includes one-day and same-day shipping as well as the classic two-day shipping. Those benefits added up to a lot of packages - five billion items were shipped with Amazon Prime in 2017.",Jeff Bezos explains why he will never be satisfied with Amazon's success
"['Chris Crouse', 'Getty Images']",2018-04-19 00:00:00,"Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is very proud, in fact he is 'particularly proud' of a unique benefit that the company provides to its employees: the chance to go back to school and learn some in-demand skills for the workplace.  With, Amazon Career Choice, Amazon pre-pays 95 percent of up to $12,000 in tuition, fees, and textbooks for its hourly associates looking to earn certificates or associate degrees in high-demand occupations such as aircraft mechanics, computer-aided design, machine tool technologies, medical lab technologies, and nursing.  Bezos noted this program as a point of pride in his closely watched annual letter to shareholders, released on Wednesday, where he wrote that the company funds education in the areas regardless of whether they are related to the employee's current operations.  Training and educating workers, particular those who are not full-time, has become a key topic and area of investment for major corporations.  Disney recently announced an $50 million education initiative that will be available to the company's 88,000 hourly employees. The company cited the 2018 tax reform bill as motivation for the initiative and said that participants in their program can pursue ""qualifying higher education or vocational training"" that are outside the scope of their current responsibility.  AT&T is retraining hundreds of thousands of workers as part of a $1 billion investment to prepare them for the future.  Education technology company Coursera announced a partnership this year with Alphabet's Google to train IT professionals, with Google granting 10,000 scholarships to Coursera's online program to help meet the growing demand for tech support specialists.  A focus from Amazon on educating lower-level employees is not too surprising when considering this salary tidbit: the median worker compensation at Amazon is a little over $28,000, according to a Bloomberg report.  Amazon's Career Choice, which launched in 2012 and is live in 10 countries, will expand to South Africa, Costa Rica, and Slovakia later this year. More than 16,000 associates have joined since its inception with roughly three-fourths of the employees residing in the U.S. Commercial truck driving, health care, and information technology are the program's most popular fields of study, Bezos noted in the letter.

Amazon was gaining ground Thursday afternoon, up 1.67%, after CEO Jeff Bezos released a letter to shareholders saying 100 million people paid for Prime globally. This is the first time Amazon has revealed the number of paid Prime subscribers.  The big reveal from Bezos comes as Amazon finds itself in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly railed against the company.  ""Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon,"" Trump tweeted earlier in April. ""THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!""  Last week, by executive order, Trump ordered the creation of a task force to look into the US Postal Service's struggles. And while the order didn't name Amazon, it asked the task force to examine ""the expansion and pricing of the package delivery market and the USPS's role in competitive markets,"" among other things.  Details of how much Amazon pays to the postal service are not publicly known.  Bezos' letter to shareholders comes ahead of the company's first-quarter results, which are scheduled to be released next Thursday.

[],2018-04-19 00:00:00,"Credit: Luke MacGregor/Bloomberg  Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said the e-commerce giant has exceeded 100 million paid Prime subscribers and will continue to invest to meet ""ever-rising"" customer expectations.  Bezos noted the milestone in his annual shareholder letter, published Wednesday. The letter is the founder's opportunity to underline his long-term strategy for investors, seeking to bolster their confidence as he continues to plow Amazon's money into expanding internationally, building a brick-and-mortar presence and introducing new products such as Echo speakers and the Alexa voice-activated digital assistant.  Prime subscribers pay monthly or annual fees in exchange for quick delivery of online orders, music and video streaming and free online photo storage. The memberships encourage consumers to shop more with Amazon to get their money's worth, similar to warehouse clubs like Costco. Amazon took its memberships a step further with additional digital perks, and sells add-ons including a more robust music catalog for an additional monthly fee.  Amazon has kept its Prime subscriber number a closely held secret, forcing analysts to estimate the figure based on shopper surveys. Bezos's comments show that Seattle-based company is selling Prime memberships overseas, demonstrating it can replicate its U.S. success abroad, said RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar. Amazon is losing money with its international expansion, but investors will be patient if the company is gaining Prime subscribers, he said.  ""What we're seeing in Europe and other markets is similar to what we saw in the U.S. between 2010 and 2014,"" Hottovy said. ""People see value in Prime memberships in terms of shipping speed and content. It's important to investors because membership retention rates are north of 90 percent.""  Bezos cited Amazon's continued high marks from independent surveys, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index, as proof that the company continues to invent new ways to please customers, giving them new things they didn't realize they wanted.  ""You cannot rest on your laurels in this world,"" he wrote. ""Customers won't have it.""  The shareholder letter praises Amazon's corporate culture, with Bezos maintaining that high standards are ""teachable.""  ""People are pretty good at learning high standards simply through exposure,"" he said. ""High standards are contagious. Bring a new person onto a high standards team, and they'll quickly adapt. The opposite is also true. If low standards prevail, those too will quickly spread.""  The CEO also said that in 2017 Amazon shipped more than 5 billion items with Prime worldwide and more new members joined Prime than in any previous year. He added that 2017 was best year for hardware sales and that the company will continue to invest aggressively to expand its customer base, brand and infrastructure.  Amazon shares rose about 1.5 percent in extended trading after the letter was published.  Bezos's annual letter has special importance because investors aren't drawn to Amazon for its profits. The company's margins have been slimmer than 2 percent since 2011. They're investing instead in Bezos's ability to push into new markets and find fresh sources of revenue, which jumped 31 percent last year to $178 billion. Amazon shares are up almost 70 percent in the past year, nearly five times the gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.  Amazon has a big lead in cloud computing, a profitable and fast-growing market. It's building an advertising business to capitalize on its consumer web traffic. And the company is betting the Alexa voice-activated platform will become the next wave of interactions between people and devices, supplementing the computer mouse and touch-screen interfaces.  The company also faces new threats. Amazon is locked in a costly price war with Walmart as the two retail behemoths fight for dominance of the $800 billion grocery business. And President Donald Trump has complained repeatedly that Amazon doesn't pay its fair share of taxes, is hurting traditional retailers and is getting a sweetheart deal from the U.S. Postal Service‚Äîa criticism that could drive up Amazon's delivery costs if it leads to new USPS package rates. Bezos didn't mention Trump's attacks in his letter, maintaining the company's silence on the issues.  To keep the faith of investors, Bezos always includes his 1997 shareholder letter to remind them of his ability to foresee the way the internet would change the nature of shopping. He also offers historical anecdotes, like him driving to the post office in his Chevy Blazer and dreaming of owning a forklift one day, to point out how far the company has progressed.  As the world's wealthiest man, Bezos's strategy and outlook have developed a cult-like following similar to that of Warren Buffett, whose annual letters to Berkshire Hathaway investors are must-reads for those looking to understand the economy and Buffett's investment strategy. Buffett now ranks third on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, behind Bezos and Microsoft founder Bill Gates.  In another first, the company disclosed the median annual pay for Amazon workers other than Bezos, which was $28,446, reflecting the large number of retail and warehouse employees on staff. That number was listed in Amazon's annual proxy statement, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. Also in that document was pay for top executives including Bezos, whose total 2017 compensation of $1.68 million included $81,840 in salary and $1.6 million for the cost of ""security arrangements"" for the CEO. The ratio between the median pay number and Bezos's total was 1 to 59.  ‚ÄîSpencer Soper, Bloomberg News","Amazon now has 100 million paid Prime subscribers, Jeff Bezos says"

[],2018-04-19 00:00:00,"Amazon has announced the yield from its money mine for the full year 2017: on full-year sales of US$178 billion, it generated an operating income of $4 billion and net income of $3 billion.  The Bezos Bunch pulled most of its retail business in the Christmas period, since as we reported in February, Q4 2017 netted $1.9 billion, nearly two-thirds of its net income.  AWS is still only a small part of the cash machine, with full year sales of $17.5 billion, but that's leaped from under $8 billion in the 2015 financial year. It's accelerating, though: CEO Jeff Bezos said it's hit a $20bn annual revenue run-rate.  The cloud service's growth has slowed over that time, as is normal from a low base: from 70 per cent for 2015, to 55 per cent in 2016 and 43 per cent in 2016. At that rate, it'll be a paltry $20 billion or so next year.  Amazon's proxy statement includes its first CEO-to-worker full-year pay ratio disclosure: Jeff Bezos takes home a relatively modest $1.68 million a year, 59 times his staff average of $28,446 ($36,500 in Australia, ‚Ç§20,000 or ‚Ç¨23,000).  Amazon warns you have 30 days before Music Storage files bloodbath READ MORE  In other words, Silicon Valley image aside, Amazon is overwhelmingly a retail company, paying far, far below tech-sector incomes.  It should be remembered that Amazon has a genuinely worldwide workforce among its 560,000 staff, many of which won't command Silicon Valley pay packets ‚Äì not to mention an unknown number of part-time staff, mostly in its logistical operations.  The company has also published Bezos' annual Letter to Shareholders, which comes close to self-help gobbledegook as it spans the philosophy of workplace standards as exemplified by taking yoga to learn how to execute the perfect handstand, soaring over Amazon customers' ‚Äúdivine discontent‚Äù, and nodding towards ‚Äúcustomer empowerment‚Äù before settling into breathless praise of every single line of business).  Tucked underneath that and a restatement of Bezos' long-standing commitment to the power of the six-page memo as a management construct, we learn for the first time in its thirteen-year history that Amazon Prime has 100 million customers.  Alexa, we learn, is getting better at listening to its owners from further away, with a claimed far-field speech recognition improvement of 15 per cent. Outside developers have contributed more than 30,000 skills to the geegaw, and 1,200 smart-home vendors now let Alexa control more than 4,000 individual devices. There's no word on total Alexa units sold, however, but Bezos says it's ‚Äúamong the best-selling items across all of Amazon‚Äù.  Echo, Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick and Alexa went out the door in their ‚Äútens of millions‚Äù, Bezos wrote, and while we don't know how many customers have signed for Prime Video, the CEO promised a heavy production workload of new content.  ‚ÄúIn 2017, Prime Video Direct secured subscription video rights for more than 3,000 feature films and committed over $18 million in royalties to independent filmmakers and other rights holders‚Äù, the shareholder letter says (the average of $6,000 per rights-deal suggests Amazon expects a high attrition rate between deal-signed and show-screened).  If share analysts want to divine anything concrete from Amazon's future plans, they'll need to engage a medium or two. Here's what Jeff has to say under the heading ‚ÄúPath Ahead‚Äù:  ‚ÄúThis year marks the 20th anniversary of our first shareholder letter, and our core values and approach remain unchanged. We continue to aspire to be Earth‚Äôs most customer-centric company, and we recognise this to be no small or easy challenge.

['Khari Johnson'],2018-04-18 00:00:00,"Amazon has more than 100 million Prime members around the world, CEO Jeff Bezos revealed in an annual letter sent to shareholders today. Amazon first began to extend Prime benefits to its customers 13 years ago, but the company never shared how many paying customers had signed up until now.  Much of the letter focused on the importance of high standards, but it also touted recent achievements, like the spread of Amazon Lockers at hundreds of Whole Foods stores and expansion of Prime benefits to countries like Mexico and Singapore.  Estimates from earlier this year found that nearly half of U.S. households have a Prime membership. More new Prime members signed up last year than any prior year, including 4 million in one week in late 2017.  The news comes a day after Amazon said it will get rid of the Whole Foods loyalty program in two weeks in order to make Prime membership the primary way to share benefits with shoppers, something the company has signaled since completion of the $13.7 billion acquisition last summer. Work is still being done to make Prime membership recognized at Whole Foods checkout stands, Bezos said in the letter. Free two-hour delivery for Whole Foods purchases over $35 was extended to Prime Now members in February.  Prime benefits added within the past year include two-minute order fulfillment at Instant Pickup sites, Amazon Key in-home deliveries, and free access to Double Jeopardy!, the first paid subscription game on Echo devices.  Bezos also addressed things like Amazon‚Äôs growth in India, cashierless Amazon Go stores, and improvements to Alexa‚Äôs intelligence that took place within the past year.  ‚ÄúFar-field speech recognition (already very good) has improved by 15 percent over the last year; and in the U.S., U.K., and Germany, we‚Äôve improved Alexa‚Äôs spoken language understanding by more than 25 percent over the last 12 months through enhancements in Alexa‚Äôs machine learning components and the use of semi-supervised learning techniques,‚Äù Bezos said in the letter.

['Larry Dignan'],,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said Prime now has more than 100 million paid members globally.  The milestone, outlined in Amazon's annual shareholder letter, was used an example of the company's innovation and knack for finding new markets.  Bezos' annual letter has become a business and technology must read given Amazon's success.  Prime, AWS and Alexa were held up as examples of how high standards are teachable, but you must recognize the opportunities.  Here's a look at a few management takeaways from Bezos for 2018:  1. High standards are required because customer expectations only increase.  Bezos noted:  One thing I love about customers is that they are divinely discontent. Their expectations are never static - they go up. It's human nature. We didn't ascend from our hunter-gatherer days by being satisfied. People have a voracious appetite for a better way, and yesterday's 'wow' quickly becomes today's 'ordinary'. I see that cycle of improvement happening at a faster rate than ever before.  2. To stay ahead of expectations, you can't be afraid to fail.  3. You can teach high standards.  Bezos said:  I believe high standards are teachable. In fact, people are pretty good at learning high standards simply through exposure. High standards are contagious. Bring a new person onto a high standards team, and they'll quickly adapt. The opposite is also true. If low standards prevail, those too will quickly spread.  4. Standards are domain specific.  You'll need to learn high standards in every arena of interest. That approach has paid off for AWS, Alexa and retail.  Must read: What is cloud computing? Everything you need to know about the cloud, explained  5. You need to recognize what good looks like as well as what'll it take to achieve the desired result.

Bezos said:  We don't do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon. Instead, we write narratively structured six-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of ""study hall."" Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely. Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum.

Amazon has been operating its cashierless Go stores since late January.  The store features Amazon's ""just walk out"" technology, which uses sensors and cameras to track what customers take off shelves and out of the store. Located in Seattle, near Amazon's campus, it's seen as the future of brick-and-mortar retail, with complicated technology that's designed to make in-store shopping as seamless and easy as shopping on Amazon.com.  The opening of the store brought a lot of interest from locals, and lines soon formed on opening day  In a letter to investors, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos spoke with pride about hearing customers call the experience of shopping in the new store ""magical.""  He also revealed the top-selling items for the small-footprint, convenience-oriented store. Items like coffee and water are popular, as would be expected at a store of this kind.  But it's the prepared food items - chicken banh mi sandwiches, chocolate chip cookies, and pre-cut fruit - that are keeping customers coming back. Gummy bears were another favorite, according to Bezos' letter, as were Amazon's meal kits.  Bezos didn't reveal what the future of the store is, but it's likely it won't stay in Seattle forever.  According to a Recode report from February, new Go stores could open in as many as six new locations in at least two cities in 2018.  Three new locations in Seattle have been identified by the company, according to the Recode report, as well as one in Los Angeles.

Jeff Bezos is pulling the curtain back on Prime.  In his latest letter to shareholders, the Amazon CEO shared that Prime has more than 100 million subscribers globally.  This is the first time that Amazon has revealed just how many people pay for Prime. Estimates from analysts pegged it at about 90 million as recently as last year.  Bezos went on to explain how much Prime has expanded since it was founded 13 years ago. The membership now includes one-day and same-day shipping as well as the classic two-day shipping. Those benefits added up to a lot of packages - five million items were shipped with Amazon Prime in 2017.  He also revealed that more new Prime members signed up in 2017 than any year prior.

[],2018-04-18 14:30:00-07:00,"Getty  Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos revealed Wednesday that its Prime membership service has over 100 million paid customers worldwide.  The company hasn't previously offered a specific number about its Prime members, instead keeping the size of one of its most important businesses a secret until now. Amazon has previously said it has tens of millions of Prime members in the US and tens of millions internationally.  Because Amazon has kept up the secret for so long, many industry analysts have instead spent years estimating the Prime membership rolls, often offering up numbers that were tens of millions apart from each other. Without knowing how big Prime is or how much it's growing, it's been difficult to figure out how successful the program has been.  ""I'm extremely proud to share some of the milestones we hit last year, each of which represents the fruition of many years of collective effort. We take none of them for granted,"" Bezos wrote in his annual shareholder letter, where he revealed the Prime membership number.  The 100 million mark likely shows rival retailers that Amazon's dominance in e-commerce and beyond is bound to continue. It also should give Amazon even more reason to keep expanding to new countries and adding benefits to Prime, which costs $99 in the US, so it can continue bringing in new customers to the program.  Prime -- a 13-year-old membership program that includes unlimited two-day shipping, a streaming video library and a bunch of other perks -- is a vital part of Amazon's business, since members tend to spend about twice as much on the website as non-Prime shoppers, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.  There are currently 16 Prime countries, with the US the biggest market. The other countries are Canada, Mexico, UK, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, China, India, Japan and Singapore. Australia is expected to get Prime later this year.  As part of his letter, Bezos also said that for the first time in Amazon's history, its third-party marketplace last year accounted for more than half of its sales. According to Amazon's latest earnings report, marketplace sales have accounted for 50 percent to 51 percent of sales over the past year. The marketplace includes 2 million independent sellers worldwide who offer up their goods on Amazon along with the company's direct sales.  The marketplace helps Amazon vastly expand its inventory and it's generally more profitable than Amazon's direct sales, since Amazon doesn't purchase the items itself.

Shriram had been discretely advising two Stanford PhD students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who were trying to invent a new way of searching the internet. In February of 1998, Shriram became one of the first early investors of Google, with a $250,000 investment.  Six months later, Bezos and his wife were vacationing in the Bay Area when he reached out to Shriram with a request to meet the guys behind Google. Shriram invited the Bezos,' along with Page and Brin, to his house for breakfast with a demonstration of how the search engine would operate. Bezos immediately told Shriram he wanted to invest.  It took some convincing on Shriram's part, since the early funding cycle had closed, but Bezos' status as a CEO with a then $1.6 billion net worth swayed Google's founders to let him in.  ""Jeff was very helpful in some of those early meetings,"" Page said in the book.  Google is now counted among the top four most valuable companies in the world, along with Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. The Google Home smart speaker rivals that of Amazon's and Google isn't slowing down with its strides in smart home technology.  Bezos ended up investing $1 million in Google, according to several reports. It's unclear if Bezos still owns the stake - the book explains Bezos's constant unwillingness to discuss what he did with his Google holdings after the company went public in 2004.  But it's safe to assume the investment would probably be worth billions today, which would have made Bezos a rich man even if he'd never started Amazon in his garage.

[],,"The richest people in the world found success at various ages.  Warren Buffett spent over 25 years as a millionaire before becoming a billionaire, while it took Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos less than two years to graduate to billionaire status.  The richest people in tech averaged five years as millionaires before becoming billionaires.  The richest people in the world have varied origin stories.  Mark Zuckerberg cofounded Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004. By 2007, he was a millionaire. One year later Facebook debuted on the New York Stock Exchange as the biggest tech IPO in history, minting the world's youngest self-made billionaire at the time: 23-year-old Zuckerberg.  Berkshire Hathaway founder Warren Buffett 's long-game investing strategies finally cemented his billionaire status at 56 - about 26 years after he first joined the seven-figure club. At age 87, he's now worth nearly $85 billion.  Amazon founder Jeff Bezos was a millionaire for two years before he became a billionaire in 1998, when Amazon went public. At the time, Buffett commanded a fortune of nearly $30 billion. Nearly 20 years later, Bezos is about $30 billion richer than Buffett.  Betway, an online betting site, used Forbes 2018 Billionaire's List and Bloomberg's Billionaire Index to find out how long it took the richest people in the world to go from millionaire to billionaire. The blog looked at when each person first appeared on either list, and also gathered news reports and rankings to pinpoint their age at the time. When it wasn't possible to find an exact age, Betway Insider made an estimate based on the individual's first big success in business.  Tech appears to be the fastest wealth-building industry; the richest people in tech averaged five years as millionaires before becoming billionaires.  Check out the graphic below to see how long it took the richest people in the world to go from millionaire to billionaire.

[],,"Amazon just made its biggest deal ever: buying Whole Foods.  As Business Insider's Bob Bryan reported, Amazon will purchase the grocer for $42 a share in an all-cash deal, valuing the company at $13.7 billion.  To gain some insight into how Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos might have made the decision to acquire Whole Foods, we turned back to an oft-cited interview with Bezos.  In the interview, which appears to have been conducted by the Academy of Achievement, Bezos discusses his ""regret minimization framework."" (We first came across this snippet of the interview in Jenny Blake's 2016 book, "" Pivot ."")  Here's what Bezos said:  ""'I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, 'OK, I'm looking back on my life. I want to minimize the number of regrets I have.' ""And I knew that when I was 80, I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed, I wouldn't regret that. ""But I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day.""  Bezos has made embracing failure an integral part of business at Amazon. Business Insider's Eugene Kim has reported that Bezos ""says nine times out of ten, you're going to fail. But every once in while, you'll hit a home run that in business terms is more like 1,000 runs. 'Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time,' Bezos says.""  Bezos is hardly the only successful person to use this strategy. In a video interview with Business Insider, Tony Robbins said that whenever he's hesitant about doing something that scares him, he imagines himself at age 85, sitting in his rocking chair and looking back on his life.  At that point, he asks himself, would he experience greater regret over having done the scary thing or opted out?  It's probably a useful question for everyone - even those who haven't achieved the same level of notoriety as Bezos or Robbins - to ask ourselves.",Jeff Bezos uses a simple exercise to decide which risks are worth taking
[],,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's notes for testifying in front of Congress quote a line from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos about companies that ""work hard to charge you less.""  Amazon's strategy of working hard to charge less was reportedly inspired by a 2001 meeting between Bezos and Costco's co-founder.  While tech CEOs have adopted the strategy (and the ""Jeffism""), few companies cut prices with greater efficiency than Costco.  Mark Zuckerberg took a note straight out of Costco's playbook while testifying in front of Congress this week.  When photographers managed to capture a photo of the Facebook CEO and founder's private notes on Tuesday, viewers with particularly sharp eyes may have caught a reference to Costco - by way of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.  ""Bezos: 'Companies that work hard to charge you more and companies that work hard to charge you less,'"" one of Zuckerberg's bullets reads.  ""At FB, we try hard to charge you less,"" the following bullet reads. ""In fact, we're free.""  The note appears to reference a well-known line from an Amazon earnings call in 2001, first spotted by The Puget Sound Business Journal.  The full quote is: ""There are two kinds of retailers: there are those folks who work to figure how to charge more, and there are companies that work to figure out how to charge less, and we are going to be the second, full-stop.""  Bezos' line of thinking was apparently inspired by a meeting with Costco co-founder Jim Sinegal in 2001. According to Brad Stone's ""The Everything Store,"" Bezos' meeting with Sinegal inspired the CEO to change Amazon's ""incoherent"" pricing strategy to match retailers like Walmart and Costco's prices - all the time.  In July, reportedly as a result of the meeting, Amazon announced it would cut prices of books, music, and videos by 20 to 30%. In the earnings call announcing the change, Bezos dropped his ""two kinds of retailers"" line - a ""new Jeffism,"" Stone writes, ""to be repeated over and over ad nauseam for years.""  Zuckerberg has become one of the many Bezos devotees repeating the ""Jeffism.""  ""I thought Jeff Bezos had an excellent saying on this in one of his Kindle launches a number of years back,"" Zuckerberg said in an interview with Vox's Ezra Klein earlier in April.  ""He said, 'There are companies that work hard to charge you more, and there are companies that work hard to charge you less,'"" Zuckerberg continued. ""And at Facebook, we are squarely in the camp of the companies that work hard to charge you less and provide a free service that everyone can use.""  While tech CEOs have adopted the strategy, few companies ""figure out how to charge less"" with greater dedication than Costco. The bulk retailer has some of the lowest markups in the business. Fortune reports that Costco's average markup - essentially the profit it makes on each item - is 11%, compared to Walmart's nearly 24%, most supermarkets' 30%, and Home Depot's 35%.  Costco has a long list of ways to keep prices extremely low.  Unlike most rivals, the retailer doesn't advertise. It provides many types of products, but only a limited selection of each one - 3,700 products in a warehouse, compared with 140,000 at a Walmart superstore, according to Fortune. And, its membership model helps offset costs and keeps loyal customers returning to warehouses for everything they need.",Costco is inspiring tech CEOs like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg in one key way
"['Laura Stevens', 'Peter Nicholas', 'Google', 'Laura.Stevens Wsj.Com', 'Peter.Nicholas Wsj.Com']",,"For years, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN 0.30% Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has meticulously crafted his public image, largely shunning the spotlight while carefully making donations that only hint at his political agenda.  But over the past week, the billionaire has been cast into the limelight thanks to a string of attacks by President Donald Trump.  Mr. Bezos‚Äôs response? The silent treatment.  In six tweets over a week, Mr. Trump lashed out at Amazon repeatedly over taxes, its use of the U.S. Postal Service and its effect on other retailers. He also called the Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos owns personally, a lobbying arm. He criticized Amazon at a press conference on Tuesday, too, and aboard Air Force One on Thursday.  The tweets and remarks stem largely from Mr. Trump‚Äôs growing unhappiness with coverage of his administration by the Washington Post as well as with its owner, say the president‚Äôs advisers and people close to the White House.  Mr. Bezos, the world‚Äôs richest man, has ignored the president‚Äôs attacks. He has stayed out of the public eye since Mr. Trump‚Äôs tweets started last week, only tweeting once to send condolences regarding the recent shooting at YouTube‚Äôs headquarters.  Mr. Bezos made comments critical of Mr. Trump before the election, but he has refrained from public criticism since Mr. Trump was elected. That strategy, people familiar with this thinking say, fits in with his deeply held conviction in playing the long game.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any benefit to actually engaging with President Trump‚Äù as a CEO, says Paul Argenti, professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth College‚Äôs Tuck School of Business. ‚ÄúHe clearly doesn‚Äôt like them,‚Äù he said of Mr. Trump‚Äôs view of Amazon. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no sense in fighting back.‚Äù  An Amazon spokesman declined to comment. The White House also declined to comment.  Some CEOs have spoken up after Mr. Trump has criticized them or their companies. Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in a September post refuted Mr. Trump‚Äôs tweet that ‚ÄúFacebook was always anti-Trump.‚Äù AT&T Inc. CEO Randall Stephenson hinted at the president‚Äôs criticism of the company‚Äôs merger plans at a November conference, saying the company wouldn‚Äôt back down in its bid for Time Warner Inc.  Other CEOs, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.‚Äôs Lloyd Blankfein, have publicly criticized the president in response to positions such as his ban on travelers from certain countries.  Mr. Bezos has long tread carefully when it comes to politics. The chief executive has made calculated public donations, like one for so-called Dreamer scholarships in January. He tweets rarely and chooses to speak publicly only on occasion. His last major public interview was granted to his brother on stage at a conference in November.  Still, as concerns about Amazon‚Äôs growing power have ballooned in recent months, Mr. Bezos has been seen more publicly. He starred in the company‚Äôs Super Bowl commercial this year and has been making the rounds at Hollywood award shows and parties. Last month, he tweeted a photo of himself with a robotic dog at his exclusive Mars conference in Palm Springs, Calif.  Mr. Bezos was critical of Mr. Trump in the months before the election. In 2015, Mr. Bezos responded to a critical tweet from Mr. Trump by suggesting he could offer the then-candidate a ride on a spaceship. ‚Äú#sendDonaldtospace,‚Äù he added. At a conference in 2016, shortly before Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Bezos said the candidate ‚Äúerodes democracy around the edges.‚Äù Amazon became one of the first companies to sign on to a legal challenge to Mr. Trump‚Äôs travel ban last year, too, as Mr. Bezos sent an email to staff explaining his move.  Executives inside Amazon say they are well aware of the perception of the company‚Äôs growing dominance as it expands into new business areas globally and weaves its ways into consumers‚Äô lives‚Äîfrom its Whole Foods grocery stores and Hollywood studios to its recent experimentation with health care and financial services. The company has recently worked to improve its public image and its lobbying efforts, according to a person familiar with the matter. And it has made big splashes by announcing it was creating tens of thousands of jobs, including at a new second headquarters.  Policy experts and analysts say that there is little Mr. Trump could do right now to more heavily regulate Amazon.  While the company‚Äôs share price dipped as much as 8% on fears of Mr. Trump last week, it has started to recover and some analysts and investors say they expect the stock to rebound once the president moves on.  It is largely business as usual inside Amazon, people familiar with the matter say. Mr. Trump‚Äôs tweets are a topic of conversation but they haven‚Äôt raised too much concern, these people say. While the dip in the stock price has resulted in some annoyance among the rank and file, most are ignoring the flood of tweets with the expectation it will end soon, one of the people said.

Part of that calm stems from Mr. Bezos‚Äôs focus on the company‚Äôs long-term value, a theme he hits on frequently at meetings and in his annual letter to shareholders. At all-hands meetings with employees, Mr. Bezos has quoted Benjamin Graham : ‚ÄúIn the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.‚Äù  Many of Mr. Trump‚Äôs tweets seem to come in response to Washington Post articles he disliked, the people close to the White House said.

It must rankle Trump that Bezos has gotten away with so much. Trump has tweeted repeatedly that Amazon AMZN, +0.30% doesn‚Äôt pay any sales tax on the things it sells. And he complained that Amazon is so good at the art of the deal that the U.S. Postal Service loses money on each one of the millions of packages it delivers for the online retail giant.  You don‚Äôt have to be an Einstein or a Bezos-level genius to know that helping its customers avoid paying sales tax was Amazon‚Äôs killer app.  Trump is wrong about the Post Office contract (it doesn‚Äôt lose money on every delivery). And he‚Äôs wrong (mostly) about the sales tax, too.  But he is on to something here: Amazon is really good at avoiding taxes. So good that Amazon‚Äôs phenomenal success owes as much to tax avoidance as it does to free shipping.  You might think Trump would praise Bezos for his ingenuity at avoiding taxes. Remember during the debate with Hillary Clinton when Trump said the fact that he hadn‚Äôt paid any federal income tax for at least one year during the 1990s ‚Äúmakes me smart‚Äù?  Well, Jeff Bezos must be a genius if that‚Äôs the way we measure smarts.  Trump is wrong to say Amazon doesn‚Äôt pay sales taxes; it does collect and remit sales taxes in every state that has one. But that‚Äôs a relatively recent change in Amazon‚Äôs policy. For years, when Amazon was struggling to compete with more established retailers, its main competitive advantage was the fact that it didn‚Äôt collect sales taxes.  Trump praises Bezos  Amazon was acting perfectly legally in not collecting sales tax. In Trump‚Äôs phrase, ‚Äúthat made Bezos smart.‚Äù Due to a loophole in the federal law, online or catalog companies that don‚Äôt have a physical presence in a state (a ‚Äúnexus‚Äù) aren‚Äôt obligated to collect the tax that‚Äôs due the way brick-and-mortar retailers are required to. The customer is still obligated to pay sales tax on such purchases, but in the real world no one ever does.  So Amazon could afford to price its goods cheaper than a physical store could. Assuming the state sales tax is 5%, Best Buy BBY, +1.84% would have to charge $420 for a $400 TV ($400 for the TV plus $20 ‚Äúfor the governor.‚Äù) But Amazon could charge $400 for the same TV if it wanted to maximize sales. Or it could set the price at $419 and collect an extra $19 in pure profit that Best Buy couldn‚Äôt.  You don‚Äôt have to be an Einstein or a Bezos-level genius to know that helping its customers avoid paying sales tax was Amazon‚Äôs killer app. Here‚Äôs an economics research paper that says the same thing.  By the way, Amazon still doesn‚Äôt collect local sales taxes (which account for about one-fourth of sales tax revenues collected nationally). Nor does Amazon collect any sales tax on sales made by third-party companies that sell through the Amazon online portal. Amazon still earns a lot of revenue by avoiding sales taxes.  Amazon avoids $20.4 billion in sales taxes  Dean Baker and Evan Butcher did a rough calculation showing that if Amazon had always been required to collect sales taxes, it would have collected a total of $20.4 billion in sales taxes from its founding in 1994 through 2015, which is more than twice its lifetime profits of around $9.1 billion.  But wait ‚Äî there‚Äôs more tax avoidance!  Amazon barely pays any federal income tax at all. Part of that is its strategy to avoid booking any profits for years, preferring to invest everything back into the business. But part of Amazon‚Äôs low tax rate is the result of aggressive tax planning.  In October 2017, the European Commission ruled that Luxembourg had improperly allowed Amazon to evade taxes on about three-fourths of its European profits, and ordered Luxembourg to recover about $294 million from Amazon. After its investigation, Newsweek concluded that ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs success is due in large part to fiscal advantages it manufactured for itself in Luxembourg.‚Äù  In 2017, Amazon paid no federal tax on $5.6 billion in U.S. profits, according to an analysis by Matthew Gardner at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. During the previous five years, Amazon paid an effective rate of 11.4% on its profits of $8.2 billion, about a third the statutory rate, Gardner said.  ‚ÄúMore so than any company I can think of, Amazon appears to have built their profit maximization strategy around avoiding taxes at various levels,‚Äù Gardner told Alex Shepherd of The New Republic, who concluded that ‚ÄúAmazon has used local, state, and federal tax laws to its benefit, while doing everything in its power to avoid posting profits.‚Äù  Tax incentives  Amazon is also an expert in playing state and local governments off against each other, demanding large subsidies for the honor of hosting an Amazon facility. According to a conservative estimate by Good Jobs (an advocacy organization), Amazon has received about $1.4 billion in tax incentives.  All that money doesn‚Äôt really buy a community anything. The Economic Policy Institute looked at areas that had won bids to host Amazon warehouses and found that, while warehousing jobs did increase by 30%, total employment was flat in the community.  Richard Florida reached the same conclusion after investigating the benefits of some $45 billion in local tax incentives for ‚Äúeconomic development‚Äù: Handing out tax breaks to businesses is worse than useless.  And now Amazon is embarking on an even more outrageous stunt, pitting large cities against each other in a ‚ÄúHunger Games‚Äù-style competition to snag Amazon‚Äôs second headquarters‚Äô site and its promised 50,000 jobs. Amazon made it clear that tax incentives would be important in the final selection, and cities are scrambling to outbid each other.  Newark, N.J., is offering Amazon a package worth up to $7 billion, while Montgomery County, Md., just bumped up its bribe to $8.5 billion. And so on.  Amazon isn‚Äôt alone in these tax-avoidance tactics. Almost every company tries to minimize its tax burden, and many of them cross the line from time to time. So why doesn‚Äôt Trump tweet about Walmart WMT, -0.07% extorting money from towns, or about FedEx FDX, +0.70% for standing tough when it negotiates with the Post Office, or Apple AAPL, -0.25% for outsourcing its profits to Ireland?  What‚Äôs his obsession all about? Yeah, it‚Äôs probably because Bezos owns the Post. But I still believe jealousy plays a part. Trump may be president, but Bezos is king of the world.",Trump is right: Jeff Bezos is a genius at not paying taxes
['Brian Stelter'],2018-04-03 00:00:00,"""Preposterous and disingenuous.""  That's how the Washington Post is describing President Trump's insinuation that Jeff Bezos uses the newspaper to help Amazon.  Bezos is the CEO of Amazon and the owner of the Post. By all accounts he treats them as separate businesses -- but Trump seems to think otherwise.  The president has been blasting Amazon on Twitter, contributing to a sell-off of the company's stock. One of the president's tweets brought up the Post connection by saying the paper should register as an Amazon lobbyist.  Many observers have concluded that Trump's anti-Amazon statements are, at least in part, a form of punishment for the Post's aggressive coverage.

['Brad Tuttle'],,"Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos once offered up one of his rockets to shoot Donald Trump out into space. Over the past week, Bezos could be wishing that had actually happened‚Äîbecause tweets by President Trump bashing Amazon appear to be costing Bezos billions of dollars.  Bezos is the world‚Äôs richest man, with a net worth estimated over $100 billion since the start of the year. Bezos‚Äôs wealth is based largely on the price of Amazon stock, and as shares soared in early 2018 his fortune grew by more than $30 billion. As of Monday, March 26, Jeff Bezos‚Äôs net worth stood at nearly $130 billion, according to both Forbes and the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.  Yet one week‚Äîand four Amazon-related Trump tweets later ‚Äî Bezos‚Äôs net worth is down to $114 billion, Forbes estimates. In a dismal day for stocks in general, Amazon shares dropped an especially steep 6% on Monday. Over the past week, Amazon‚Äôs stock price has dropped by around 10%, subtracting roughly $16 billion away from Bezos.  While it‚Äôs impossible to pinpoint the exact reason any individual stock or the broader stock market rises and falls, recent social media messages directed at Amazon by the ‚ÄúTweeter in Chief‚Äù seem to be a factor. In a string of tweets, President Donald Trump has attacked Amazon and Bezos over the past week for paying too little in taxes and taking advantage of the postal service, among other things.  Long before Trump became president, he was highly critical of the coverage he received by the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, and claimed that Amazon was using the Post as a lobbyist to help the company lower its taxes. In December 2015, Trump trashed Amazon and the Washington Post in one Twitter message.  Bezos responded on his personal Twitter account by saying that he would reserve Trump a seat on a rocket bound for space.  On the day after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Amazon‚Äôs stock price dropped significantly, presumably due to Trump‚Äôs stance against Bezos and the companies he owns. As president, Trump has periodically criticized and threatened Amazon on Twitter, saying that the company kills jobs and doesn‚Äôt pay taxes.  Many have theorized that Trump‚Äôs feud with Bezos and Amazon is motivated by more than Trump‚Äôs concern about companies paying their fair share of taxes. After all, the Trump administration pushed for a cut in the corporate tax rate that saved Amazon $789 million. Trump also prides himself as a savvy businessman, and even said in a presidential debate that he personally was ‚Äúsmart‚Äù for avoiding taxes.  Trump‚Äôs attacks on Amazon also seem to go beyond worries about the post office‚Äôs finances, the retail industry and its workers, and even how he‚Äôs portrayed by Washington Post. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs obsessed with Amazon,‚Äù one Washington insider reportedly told Axios last week.  ‚ÄúThe very existence of Bezos seems to drive Trump crazy,‚Äù Bloomberg columnist Virginia Postrel wrote. Whereas Trump was born rich and has always courted attention as a domineering brash playboy entrepreneur, Bezos‚Äôs fortune is 100% self-made, and he‚Äôs known to be quiet, nerdy, and self-deprecating. ‚ÄúHe is a far more admired and influential businessman than Trump and, of course, immeasurably richer.‚Äù  On Monday alone, Bezos lost on paper as much as $7 billion‚Äîwhich is more than twice as much as the total net worth of Donald Trump. Even after Bezos‚Äôs fortune fell by $16 billion, to $114 billion, he is still roughly 38 times richer than Trump, whose net worth is estimated at $3 billion.",Jeff Bezos Has Lost $16 Billion Since Donald Trump Started Tweeting About Amazon

Instead, it's continually branching out into - and potentially threatening the stalwarts in - new industries, from ocean shipping to student loans.  Sanders' remarks on CNN came after he criticized Amazon and other tech giants in an interview with The Guardian last week.  ""When you have companies like Amazon that have extraordinary power, when you have companies like Facebook that to a significant degree control discourse, am I concerned about monopoly power? Absolutely,"" he told The Guardian. ""We need to have the kind of discussion that Congress has not had yet.""  Trump has repeatedly attacked Amazon amid a long-running feud with CEO Jeff Bezos.

Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.  In the deepest, darkest years of grad school, when it felt like my inevitable fate was to be an adjunct professor of political science at some wind-swept campus 500 miles from my nearest friend, I did something that is still seen as anathema among many followers of the academic cult: I looked around for other options and secretly signed up for an internship with a management consultancy.  All in all, it was a very positive experience. The companies we advised were doing interesting work. My colleagues were smart and personable. Most surprisingly, they seemed to think that I actually had something valuable to offer. Though I ultimately decided not to join, I learned a lot from the months I spent at ‚Äúthe firm,‚Äù as its employees ominously called it.  But for all that was positive about the experience, I did also find it to be genuinely surprising‚Äînot to say concerning‚Äîin one key respect. High-end shops like Bain, the Boston Consulting Group, or McKinsey pride themselves in being ‚Äústrategy consultancies,‚Äù the idea being that they mostly abstain from helping corporations to solve short-term tactical or operative challenges. What makes them special, and justifies their steep fees, is that they make big corporations thrive over the long run.  So I was surprised to learn what senior partners at the firm actually meant by ‚Äúlong-term‚Äù strategy. When I first asked them about the time frame they had in mind, I expected them to say 10, 20, perhaps even 30 years; instead, everyone I asked gave an answer that ranged somewhere from one to five years. A lot has been written about the fact that most people actually running big corporations day to day have trouble thinking beyond the end of the next quarter. What I find even more striking, in some ways, is that the people who are hired to remedy this shortcoming have a time horizon of, at best, half a decade.  I‚Äôve been thinking about this curious fact a lot since Donald Trump took office. The short time frame on which most business leaders concentrate explains why Trump‚Äôs tax reform has proven so popular on Wall Street. Though virtually all economists doubt that these measures will help America‚Äôs economy grow over the next 10 or 20 years, most of them do think that they will increase the short-term profitability of the country‚Äôs biggest corporations. And for a lot of the people making decisions in C-suites around the country, or deciding whether to buy more stock, that‚Äôs what matters most.  I‚Äôve been thinking about it even more over the past few days, as Trump has mounted a series of attacks on Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post.* ‚ÄúI have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election,‚Äù he tweeted last Thursday. ‚ÄúUnlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!‚Äù  A lot of commentators have been tempted to get drawn into a debate about whether or not Amazon really does need to be regulated more strictly and taxed more heavily. Damon Linker, a columnist for the Week who is usually one of the most perceptive chroniclers of Trump‚Äôs America, for example, panned the left for being outraged by Trump‚Äôs tweets. Pointing out the many ways in which Amazon really does profit from tax evasion, and really is too big to allow real competition, he asked whether it ‚Äúmakes sense for liberals to rally around Bezos in response? Not at all‚Äîat least not if the left in this country wants to stand for more than reflexive opposition to whatever Trump says or does.‚Äù  This completely misses the point. There are thousands of companies in America whose profits depend in good part on their ability to win favorable rules and regulations by wielding their political influence. Liberals do need to make the fight against this kind of crony capitalism a central rallying cry. And, yes, when they do that, they need to be no less sparing in their criticism of Amazon as in that of ExxonMobil or Goldman Sachs. But when the president is busy handing out large presents to businesses around the country and stuffing his tax reform full of loopholes demanded by lobbyists, it is na√Øve to pretend that his hostility to Amazon is motivated by anything other than an attempt to curb the critical coverage of Bezos‚Äôs Washington Post.  Linker concedes that ‚Äúit‚Äôs entirely possible that this is what‚Äôs motivating Trump,‚Äù but the president‚Äôs intentions have been transparent all along. As Trump wrote in a subsequent tweet, he is keen to punish ‚Äúthe Fake Washington Post, which is used as a ‚Äòlobbyist‚Äô and should so REGISTER.‚Äù In other words, Trump‚Äôs criticisms of Amazon are not meant to fight crony capitalism; they are meant to deepen crony capitalism‚Äîand stifle freedom of speech‚Äîby punishing a major media institution for the crime of criticizing the administration.  Make no mistake: Trump‚Äôs attacks on Amazon and the Washington Post are a political scandal of the first order.  It is perfectly plausible that Trump may allow his dislike of the Washington Post to drive decisions that will negatively affect Amazon. (In fact, it is quite plausible that he has already allowed his dislike of CNN to drive a decision that has negatively affected its parent company, Time Warner.) But even if the words of the president never actually influence the actions of the regulatory agencies he controls, it could have a chilling effect on the freedom of speech these crucial outlets enjoy. After all, their owners have no better way of knowing whether they might soon be punished for criticizing the president than we do. If they care about their bottom line, they may therefore tell their journalists to refrain from being too critical of Trump‚Äîor decide that it‚Äôs safer to sell outlets that, after all, only make up a small part of their portfolio to owners who are more willing to do Trump‚Äôs bidding. What Germans call vorauseilender Gehorsam, or anticipatory obedience, is a powerful force.  In many countries around the world, authoritarian populists have managed to concentrate power in their own hands while retaining regular elections and pretending to preserve a modicum of free speech. In every case, informal influence over the owners of the country‚Äôs biggest private media outlets has been a key tool: Rather than openly shutting down critical newspapers or television stations, leaders like Hungary‚Äôs Viktor Orb√°n have used government regulations to create incentives for favorable coverage or to give critical owners a reason to sell to more friendly ones.  That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a huge mistake to say that the president‚Äôs attempt to use his political power to retaliate against a key critic should be written off as just another mindless tweet. Make no mistake: Trump‚Äôs attacks on Amazon and the Washington Post are a political scandal of the first order. Anybody who downplays it because Amazon should be regulated more strongly is making the same mistake as somebody who refuses to defend the FBI or the Department of Justice against the Trump administration because of the‚Äîundoubtedly serious‚Äîproblem of police violence.  Another aspect of Trump‚Äôs attack on Amazon has received even less serious attention: the potential economic impact of an administration that is willing to wield the tools of the regulatory state to punish its enemies. The markets don‚Äôt seem to be overly spooked by Trump‚Äôs decision to go on the attack against Bezos. Amazon‚Äôs stock price has barely been affected. Other CEOs seem to think that they have nothing much to fear from the beef between Trump and Bezos.  But that is far too short-term a way of viewing the matter. As historians, economists, and political scientists have shown over and over again, rule of law is arguably the most important predictor of economic growth. For an economy to grow at its maximum potential, investors need to know that their property is secure, economic rather than political facts need to determine which company thrives, and corruption needs to be minimal. As anybody who has done business in politically challenging environments knows, it‚Äôs impossible to have these conditions when a strongman leader can punish corporations at will: In such countries, you need to flatter the leader at every turn, your ability to turn a profit depends on the quality of your political patronage, and anybody who is close to power feels entitled to a sizable payoff.  To be sure, it would take a lot for the United States to suffer the kind of rampant corruption that is endemic in countries like Russia or Venezuela. On the whole, our legal system continues to be independent. Far from being cowed by politicians, American business leaders feel entitled to ignore requests to testify in front of Congress. Trump‚Äôs tweets aren‚Äôt an imminent threat to the American economy.  And yet it strikes me that America‚Äôs business community is vastly underestimating the disastrous consequences that populism‚Äîon the right, not just the left‚Äîhas had on economic performance in countries around the world. If you are only looking at the next quarter, or even the next five years, the political threat to the economy is probably minimal. But if you want to predict how America‚Äôs economy (or your business!) will perform over the next couple of decades, you need to take the danger that political loyalty to a strongman leader will start to be necessary for economic success‚Äîand that corruption will become evermore rampant as the regulatory state does the president‚Äôs bidding‚Äîvery seriously indeed.

"['James Freeman', 'Google', 'James.Freeman Wsj.Com']",,"From one Washington to the other, investors, consumers and retailers are wondering how the Trump administration is going to attack Amazon.com . Here‚Äôs an idea: Cut off government assistance and then leave the online retailer alone.  ‚ÄúI have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!,‚Äù tweets President Donald Trump today.  This morning‚Äôs presidential broadside at the Seattle-based tech giant follows a Wednesday report from the website Axios:  Capitol Hill wants Facebook ‚Äôs blood, but President Trump isn‚Äôt interested. Instead, the tech behemoth Trump wants to go after is Amazon, according to five sources who‚Äôve discussed it with him. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs obsessed with Amazon,‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúObsessed.‚Äù  What we‚Äôre hearing: Trump has talked about changing Amazon‚Äôs tax treatment because he‚Äôs worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.  A source who‚Äôs spoken to POTUS: ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law.‚Äù  Mr. Trump need wonder no more. All he has to do is overturn the Obama policy of using antitrust law to protect Amazon against competition. The Justice Department spent much of the Obama presidency suing publishers and Apple for the crime of using a different business model to try to challenge Amazon‚Äôs dominance in the market for e-books. Much of this federal assault on marketplace competition was described in a 2014 Journal editorial entitled, ‚ÄúAmazon Loves Government.‚Äù  People who love economic liberty should urge the President to order Attorney General Jeff Sessions to do everything in his power to undo the damage, which extended well beyond simply providing government protection to Amazon. A 2016 Journal editorial noted that ‚ÄúApple was arraigned on a quarter-baked theory of antitrust liability that makes a variety of routine business practices automatically illegal.‚Äù  As for the delivery services that Amazon enjoys, it seems that even people briefing the President may be confused about the benefits taxpayers are providing to the company. According to Axios:  Trump tells people Amazon has gotten a free ride from taxpayers and cushy treatment from the U.S. Postal Service.  ‚ÄúThe whole post office thing, that‚Äôs very much a perception he has,‚Äù another source said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been explained to him in multiple meetings that his perception is inaccurate and that the post office actually makes a ton of money from Amazon.‚Äù  Maybe the reason Mr. Trump keeps ignoring these explanations is because they‚Äôre wrong. Last year in a Journal op-ed, FedEx investor Josh Sandbulte wrote:  In 2007 the Postal Service and its regulator determined that, at a minimum, 5.5% of the agency‚Äôs fixed costs must be allocated to packages and similar products. A decade later, around 25% of its revenue comes from packages, but their share of fixed costs has not kept pace. First-class mail effectively subsidizes the national network, and the packages get a free ride. An April analysis from Citigroup estimates that if costs were fairly allocated, on average parcels would cost $1.46 more to deliver. It is as if every Amazon box comes with a dollar or two stapled to the packing slip‚Äîa gift card from Uncle Sam.  Amazon is big enough to take full advantage of ‚Äúpostal injection,‚Äù and that has tipped the scales in the internet giant‚Äôs favor. Select high-volume shippers are able to drop off presorted packages at the local Postal Service depot for ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù delivery at cut-rate prices. With high volumes and warehouses near the local depots, Amazon enjoys low rates unavailable to its competitors. My analysis of available data suggests that around two-thirds of Amazon‚Äôs domestic deliveries are made by the Postal Service. It‚Äôs as if Amazon gets a subsidized space on every mail truck.  If a money-losing government-backed organization is providing a service at a price below private competitors, this is the very definition of a subsidy.  As for state and local sales taxes, Mr. Trump is off the mark. Amazon collects such taxes on the sales of its own goods. While it only collects in some places for third-party sellers using its platform, the company has for years been lobbying to give states and localities more authority to extract taxes from remote sellers, probably because burdensome tax compliance is easier for Amazon than for its smaller competitors. And this handy chart from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis debunks the myth that the Internet has starved state and local governments of tax revenue.  But there is another big potential benefit that the federal government can withhold. Dan Clifton of Strategas Research writes in a note to clients today that much of the reporting on Mr. Trump and Amazon has missed a big story at the Pentagon:  Of all the stories we read yesterday... we saw very little attention paid to the one area where Trump could actually hurt Amazon ‚Äì cloud computing contracts. Tech companies have been fuming at the possibility of Amazon being the sole company awarded a multi-year cloud services contract at DoD.  So while Mr. Trump is wrong on the issue of online sales taxes, he‚Äôs correct that taxpayers have been providing benefits to Amazon. Also, there are a number of appropriate and important ways the Trump administration can act to ensure that federal policy does not provide advantages to the giant retailer.  For Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, it may seem like a lot of bad news has been coming out of Washington, DC. Now along comes an ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù of Mr. Trump‚Äôs tweets about Amazon that appears in the Washington Post, which Mr. Bezos owns. The Post highlights many of Mr. Trump‚Äôs harshest attacks on the retail giant and then concludes that ‚Äúit may be that Trump‚Äôs anti-Amazon animus, however self-interested and ill-informed, heralds a wider political reckoning with the power that tech giants have amassed.‚Äù  Post readers can make what they will of such analysis. Here‚Äôs hoping that instead of a wider political reckoning, the Trump administration focuses on simply ending Amazon‚Äôs government-created advantages.  ***  Bottom Stories of the Day  On Second Thought Maybe Tech Giants Should Face a Wider Political Reckoning  ‚ÄúSusan Rice joins Netflix board of directors,‚Äù MSN, March 28  Law & Order: Special Delivery Unit  ‚ÄúCops confront Domino‚Äôs employee over undelivered pizza, get suspended,‚Äù Fox News, March 29  We‚Äôve All Been There  ‚ÄúPensacola woman mistakes 37-week pregnancy for bad Chinese food,‚Äù Pensacola News Journal, March 28  News You Can Use  ‚ÄúOur wine columnist tasted her way through a lot of wine to find her top 10 best budget bottles,‚Äù The Wall Street Journal, March 29  Answers to Questions Nobody Is Asking  ‚ÄúThis Is What It‚Äôs Really Like to Be An Exorcist,‚Äù Reader‚Äôs Digest  Breaking News from 2008  ‚ÄúCan Obama Rescue the Democrats?,‚Äù Vanity Fair, April 2018  Longest Books Ever Written  ‚ÄúThe Decision That Hurts Your Chances of Getting Into Harvard,‚Äù The Wall Street Journal, March 28  ***  Follow James Freeman on Twitter.

[],,"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  President Donald Trump on Thursday took Twitter aim at retail giant Amazon, renewing his attacks on the company run by CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post.

""Unlike others, they pay littler or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!""

He does not have a plan to enact new regulations or taxes against Amazon, Axios reported. Amazon shares dropped sharply after the Axios report.  Meanwhile, Trump has not shown signs of interest in the ongoing Facebook controversy that linked user data from 50 million members of the social network with a data analysis firm used by his 2016 campaign, Cambridge Analytica, Axios reported.  Trump has targeted Amazon and Bezos with public comments going back to December 2015, when the then-candidate first tweeted about the company in relation to Bezos.  ""The @washingtonpost, which loses a fortune, is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon,"" Trump tweeted more than two years ago.  Bezos at the time fired back from his own Twitter account, joking that he would save a place for Trump on one of the rockets of Blue Origin, a space exploration company owned by Bezos.

"['Barry Ritholtz', 'Henry David Thoreau']",2018-03-29 09:15:17-04:00,"There was a fascinating Bloomberg column in August of last year, looking at the question of Why Jeff Bezos Grinds Trump‚Äôs Gears.  Virginia Postrel astutely notes the basis of the animus between POTUS and Amazon‚Äôs founder. It is about a whole lot more than the Bezos-owned Washington Post. (Note that everything that follows is more or less lifted wholesale from that piece; just assume its all in quotes).  The key element Postrel points to: Trump‚Äôs image of alpha male is based on a lot of falsehoods: The comparisons are not very favorable:  He inherited his wealth, did not much with it, has had ongoing family issues with affairs and divorces, was not very respected by the elite, either Manhattan Real Estate or Wall Street or Media or Academia or whoever. On the other hand, Bezos is a far more admired. He is not only the world‚Äôs wealthiest person, a self-made member of the tres-commas club, and a far more influential and successful businessman than Trump ever was. Bezos is the opposite of Trump in nearly every dimension; he is the Anti-Trump. In Trumpworld, intimidation, not value-creation, is what business is all about. Bezos has created massive value for his shareholders. Bezos has a sense of humor, laughs at his own expense. Trump is humorless. Bezos speaks clearly and has amazing message discipline; Trump‚Äôs disjointed ramblings have led to question of cognitive decline, and actual medical tests. Trump grew up rich, went to private schools, and had an undistinguished college career. Bezos grew up middle-class, went to public schools, and knocked the top out of Princeton, graduating with highest honors and Phi Beta Kappa in electrical engineering and computer science. One had a rich father; the other has brains. And then there are their families. Bezos is famously close to his. ‚ÄúThey are such a normal, close-knit family, it‚Äôs almost abnormal‚Äù  Here is the thing: Trump has been going after Amazon, making numerous false claims about what they pay in taxes, and other related nonsense.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  Amazon‚Äôs stock tumbled about 5 percent today after Axios reported that Donald Trump ‚Äúwants to go after‚Äù the company, possibly by changing its tax treatment.  This is not an especially shocking development if you‚Äôve kept up with Trump‚Äôs occasional rants about Amazon CEO and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos. Trump hates the newspaper‚Äôs critical White House coverage and has accused Bezos of using the publication as a political sword to protect Amazon‚Äôs business interests. ‚ÄúIf I become president, oh do they have problems. They‚Äôre going to have such problems,‚Äù he said during a campaign rally in 2016. According to Axios, Trump‚Äôs rich pals have added fuel to the fire by telling him that Amazon is hurting their businesses. ‚ÄúHis real estate buddies tell him‚Äîand he agrees‚Äîthat Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers,‚Äù Axios writer Jonathan Swan reports. Trump is also apparently hung up on the mistaken belief that Amazon is somehow fleecing the U.S. Postal Service. (Pretty much the opposite is true; Amazon‚Äôs packages are a crucial moneymaker for USPS.)  The president, as usual, does not have a precise game plan. He has supposedly mused about attacking Amazon on antitrust grounds, but nobody really has any idea how that would work. (Slate ran a piece last year about how the Feds could bring a competition case against the everything store; it struck this nonlawyer as interesting, but maybe a little novel for the courts.) He‚Äôs also talked about tinkering with its tax treatment.  The latter might actually get him somewhere. While Amazon already collects sales tax everywhere on the goods it sells directly, it does not collect sales tax everywhere for third-party shops that do business on Amazon Marketplace, which gives them a bit of an unfair leg up against brick-and-mortar retailers. The company started tacking state sales tax onto Marketplace orders shipped to Washington this year after the state passed a law, but is fighting a court battle over attempts to collect in South Carolina.  Amazon makes a great deal of money off of Marketplace. It earned more than $10.5 billion in fees from merchants last quarter, up 38 percent year-over-year, compared with $35.3 billion from its own direct sales. That breakneck growth might slow a bit if all Marketplace sales finally had to include sales tax.  That wouldn‚Äôt be an entirely bad thing. When it comes to sales taxes, Amazon and its flock of smaller third-party merchants should be forced onto an even playing field with local retailers. States are already pushing things in that direction regardless. But if Trump‚Äôs rage at Bezos spurred Congress to move on the issue and more broadly modernize the law governing internet sales taxes, it would present a rare silver lining to the president‚Äôs seething resentments. To be sure, the spectacle of a White House using legislation to punish a media owner might be less than great for civil society and would probably send yet another chilling message to would-be corporate critics. But from a tax policy perspective, it would be a fine outcome.",Donald Trump Wants to Get Revenge on Jeff Bezos by Messing With Amazon‚Äôs Taxes
[],,"Atlanta is a finalist for Amazon's second headquarters. Stonecrest, a city 20 miles east of Atlanta, has included several proposals as part of the statewide bid.  In an interview with CityLab, Stonecrest Mayor Jason Lary said he would try to de-annex part of the city and name it ""Amazon, Georgia"" if the tech giant came. Stonecrest is also proposing a shipping distribution highway called ""1000 Jeff Bezos Parkway.""  Georgia's bid signifies the lengths local politicians are willing to go to land HQ2.  The competition for Amazon's second headquarters, known as HQ2, is heating up.  Earlier this year, the tech giant announced 20 metro areas as finalists for the $5 billion campus, which is expected to bring 50,000 jobs over the next 10 to 15 years. One of those frontrunners is the Atlanta, Georgia area, which submitted a bid that includes a few proposals from the outlying city of Stonecrest.  Stonecrest outlined several perks that the tech giant could receive if it chooses Georgia as its second home.  In an interview with CityLab's Brentin Mock, Stonecrest Mayor Jason Lary said he would de-annex 345 acres (about 15 million square feet) of Stonecrest and name the new city ""Amazon, Georgia."" This area, which is mostly industrial, would serve as part or all of the HQ2 site. In Amazon's RFP, the company said it would need up to 8 million square feet of open space by 2027.  ""We'll have to create [Amazon, Georgia] through the legislature, and since I'm the architect of this city, I know how to do that,"" Lary told CityLab. ""You de-annex 345 acres, then you get the [state] senators and the House of Representatives to support it. And with a $5 billion investment at stake, it has a good chance of happening.""  In addition, Stonecrest would create an expressway and name it after Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Lary said.  ""They could have their own shipping distribution highway called 1000 Jeff Bezos Parkway,"" he told CityLab. ""How neat would that be?""  Stonecrest is a new city, so it might not be as crazy as it sounds to make such big changes. Residents of the formerly unincorporated area of southeast DeKalb County voted in November 2016 to officially incorporate into a city, a move that took effect in 2017.  While Amazon, Georgia is just a hypothetical at this point, it's not unheard of in the US to create a municipality and name it after a CEO. The practice was more common in the 19th and early 20th centuries, however.  Over the past 200 years, companies across the US have built company towns - municipalities where they own large chunks of housing, stores, schools, churches, roads, and parks. When these towns were founded, the corporation was also often the largest employer.  Examples include Hershey, Pennsylvania (named after the famed chocolatier Milton Hershey in the early 1900s) and Lowell, Massachusetts (named after Francis Cabot Lowell, the late founder of Boston Manufacturing Company, in 1823).  There is also a history in the US of public infrastructure - a proposed highway in this case - being named after CEOs. A section of California's Highway 87 in San Jose was given the namesake of ex-HP CEO Lewis Platt in 2008, while a four-lane stretch of a highway near Neodesha, Kansas honors Cobalt Boats founder and CEO Pack St. Clair.  But unlike Bezos, these CEOs had some connection to the area before the highways were built. In 1996, Platt worked as fundraising chair on a Santa Clara County campaign for highway and transit improvements, and personally raised $900,000. Cobalt Boats started manufacturing high-end speedboats in Neodesha in the late 1960s.  Beyond the prospect of Amazon coming to Georgia, Bezos has no direct relationship to the state. (The company has a few warehouses in Georgia, like it does in nearly every US state.)  1000 Jeff Bezos Parkway sounds like it would be exclusively for Amazon's shipping operations, rather than for public use. But to build it, Stonecrest could use public funds in the form of local subsidies.  Though Georgia's bid has not yet been made public, Governor Nathan Deal has implied that the state is aggressively pursuing HQ2 with economic and infrastructure incentives. At a recent city event, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed also said the state and city are offering incentives and infrastructure improvements that total more than $1 billion.  The state's bid includes urban and suburban sites and emphasizes the region's transit and airport facilities, workforce, and research universities, Atlanta's Deputy Commissioner of Global Commerce Tom Croteau told the agency's board of directors at a recent meeting in Midtown Atlanta.  Stonecrest's proposals highlight the extreme lengths that cities are willing to go in order to land HQ2. New Jersey is promising $7 billion in tax breaks; New York City is offering over 26 million square feet of space across three boroughs; and Dallas-area developers are pitching a transit-oriented development that would include a bullet train for Amazon's campus.  Amazon is currently touring its finalist cities and will make its decision in 2018.",An HQ2 finalist wants to name a city after Amazon and create a highway called 'Jeff Bezos Parkway'

Today, Village Global announced it‚Äôs raised $100 million for that fund that was first unveiled in September.  In exchange for equity, portfolio companies get investment plus mentorship from Facebook‚Äôs Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos, Microsoft‚Äôs Bill Gates, Google‚Äôs Eric Schmidt, LinkedIn‚Äôs Reid Hoffman, Disney‚Äôs Bob Iger, VMWare‚Äôs Diane Green, NYC mayor Mike Bloomberg, and more.  Village Global also announced its 90-day intensive Network Catalyst program that sees the fund get more involved in developing a startup‚Äôs product and connections. It takes 7 percent for an $120,000 investment plus admission to the program. Erik Torenberg, Product Hunt‚Äôs first employee and a founding partner of Village Global tells me that with the program ‚ÄúFounders get a ‚Äòbrain trust‚Äô assembled to fit their needs and to introduce talent, customers and investors.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI really think of Village Global as a co-founder at Keyo‚Äù says actual Keyo co-founder Kiran Bellubbi whose real estate startup we wrote about last week. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve ideated, strategized and built this business from the ground up together in under 3 months. Couldn‚Äôt have done it without this team. The pace of play is astonishing.‚Äù  Newly announced LPs and mentors for Village Global include Fidelity‚Äôs Abby Johnson, Activision‚Äôs Bobby Kotick, 23andme‚Äôs Anne Wojcicki, and Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. The question is how much these mentors will actually engage with the portfolio companies instead of just being figureheads. The program reminds me of Jay-Z‚Äôs Tidal, which signed artists like Daft Punk and Jack White as owners, but only a few like Kanye have actually done much for the company. Reid Hoffman did recently sit down with Village Global companies, though, as seen above. Village Global‚Äôs other partners like LinkedIn‚Äôs Ben Casnocha, 500 Startups‚Äô Adam Corey, Chegg‚Äôs Anne Dwane, and SuccessFactors‚Äô Ross Fubini will have to keep the big-wigs present.  Most venture funds today have a slew of general partners searching for and leading deals. A few have expansive service arms like Andreessen Horowitz‚Äôs recruiting program or GV‚Äôs design assistance. But Village Global‚Äôs approach is to have just a few partners but a ton of scouts that earn a portion of the returns if they bring in a great startup. These ‚Äúnetwork leaders‚Äù include Quora vice president Sarah Smith and YouTube‚Äôs VR lead Erin Teague. Rather than connect them to more tangible services, portfolio companies get access to Village Global‚Äôs deep mentor bench.  Other big funds have their own scout programs too that Village Global will have to compete with. The Wall Street Journal reported that Accel Partners, Founders Fund, Index Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Social Capital and Sequoia are among the top tier funds that use scouts to sniff out early stage deals. Others like First Round‚Äôs Dorm Room Fund and General Catalyst‚Äôs Rough Draft Ventures use student ambassadors on university campuses to identify high potential college startups.  It‚Äôs unclear whether letting younger, less experienced scouts write check is good for their funds or their own track records, and whether these scouts are shirking responsibilities from their own companies. But for founders, it means there are more people with their ears to the street who aren‚Äôt already famous finance big-shots. That could promote more meritocracy in an industry known for talking a lot about it despite tons of privilege given to founders of certain complexions or pedigrees.  With increased competition in the seed stage, funds can‚Äôt wait for founders to come to them any more.","Village Global raises $100M seed scout fund from Zuck, Bezos‚Ä¶"

Growth Prospects Robust  Amazon is primarily benefiting from sustained momentum in Amazon Web Services (‚ÄúAWS‚Äù) and its ubiquitous presence in retail. AWS generates much higher margins than retail, positively impacting Amazon‚Äôs profitability.  Moreover, the retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice and convenience. Moreover, the Whole Foods acquisition has helped the company rapidly penetrate the grocery segment of the brick-and-mortar stores. Further, increasing number of paid Prime members is positive.

[],,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has become the first $100 billion mogul to top Forbes' annual rankings of the world's richest people. But President Donald Trump's fortunes haven't fared as well, with Forbes estimating his wealth sank during his first year in office despite a surging stock market.  The Bezos milestone, revealed in Tuesday's release of Forbes' closely watched list, underscores the growing clout of both Bezos and the company that he founded in 1994 as an online bookstore. Forbes' breakdown provided further evidence that serving as president isn't the most lucrative job, even when most of the rich are getting richer.  All told, the world now holds more than 2,200 billionaires with a combined fortune of $9.1 trillion, up 18 percent from ago, according to Forbes' calculations.  Although Trump is part of that elite group, he saw his fortune sink by about $400 million to $3.1 billion during his first year in office. The decline left him as the world's 766th richest person, more than 200 places lower than his 544th spot on last year's Forbes list.  More billionaires were minted in 2017 than in any other year in history, Oxfam International said earlier this year. Four-fifths of the wealth created last year was claimed by the top 1 percent of income earners, the report found.  Bezos seized the top ranking for the first time and has the added the distinction of becoming the first person to break the $100 billion barrier since Forbes began compiling its list in 1987. As of Feb. 9, Bezos' wealth stood at $112 billion as of Feb. 9, up from about $73 billion last year, according to Forbes.  Most of Bezos' fortune is tied up in Amazon (AMZN) stock, which soared 59 percent during the period tracked by Forbes.  Bezos has used a sliver of his wealth to buy The Washington Post ‚Äî a target in Trump's fusillades against the media ‚Äî and to finance Blue Origin, a maker of rockets that aim to sell flights into space.  Meanwhile, Amazon has expanded beyond its bookselling origin to become a retailer of almost everything imaginable . It now even sells groceries in brick-and-mortar stores after its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Markets last year.  Amazon also has built a network of data centers that hosts the online services of other companies, and produces award-winning shows that compete against traditional TV networks. More recently, it branched into health care in a partnership involving Berkshire Hathaway and its CEO, Warren Buffett, whose $84 billion fortune ranks third on the Forbes list.  Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder and an occasional bridge partner of Buffett's, ranks second on the Forbes list with wealth of $90 billion.  Both Gates, 62, and Buffett, 87, have committed to giving away most of their wealth while Bezos, 54, hasn't said much about his philanthropic plans.","Amazon CEO Bezos reaps riches, while Trump's net worth sinks"

Another company has created a counterfeit version of the product and is selling it under the same name only it's selling it for less, stealing all the sales.  That's exactly what happened to Portland-based Elevation Lab, its founder Casey Hopkins said, accusing Amazon of being ""complicit with counterfeiting"" in a blog post. (We saw it highlighted on John Gruber's Daring Fireball.)  Amazon  The Anchor, Elevation's popular under-desk headphone mount, has been getting flooded with counterfeits, Hopkins said, noting the situation certainly isn't unique to his company.  ""The current counterfeit seller, Suiningdonghanjiaju Co Ltd (yeah they sound legit), has been on there for the past 5 days and taken all the sales,"" Hopkins wrote. Adding further insult to injury, he said Elevation has paid Amazon a ""boatload of money"" to advertise the product that it has ""built, invested in, and shipped.""  According to Hopkins, the product Suiningdonghanjiaju is selling is a poor facsimile:  They literally reverse engineered it, made steel compression molds, made the logo wrong, used fake 3M adhesive that's very thin and was diecut smaller than the top (measure once, cut twice), they use a lower durometer silicone so it flexes more, its has huge mold parting lines, and the packaging is literally photocopied then reprinted (you can tell by the lack of image contrast). And they had to apply a big sticker to cover our SKU with theirs. But to the untrained eye, it would pass. Can't wait for the negative reviews to come...  Amazon has now purged the Suiningdonghanjiaju listing, which is noted in our cart as ""no longer available from the selected seller."" It instead defaults to Elevation's own stock.  Hopkins told CNET that counterfeiters have been purged at least five times in recent weeks only to return a week later under a different seller name ""to hijack the listing."" He said it takes Amazon 5 days to remove the seller.  ""It's like whack-a-mole,"" Hopkins told CNET.  Since Elevation doesn't sell its products wholesale (except to Apple), he said it should be obvious to Amazon that any third-party seller with significant quantities is selling counterfeits. ""Amazon's policies let sellers hide behind the anonymity of the platform and they know there will be zero recourse,"" he added.  Amazon/Screenshot by John Falcone  Amazon has previously recognized it has a counterfeiter problem and has taken steps to quash it. It has sued counterfeit sellers and recently created a Brand Registry for companies to list their logos and intellectual property.  Last year, Peter Faricy, vice president of Amazon Marketplace, told Reuters that the registry would let Amazon remove listings and potentially cancel seller accounts if counterfeit products were spotted.  Hopkins said Amazon could do something very simple to fight counterfeiters, but it isn't.  ""If you have a registered brand in the Brand Registry and don't sell the product wholesale, there could be one box to check for that,"" Hopkins wrote. ""And anyone else would have to get approval or high vetting to sell the product, especially if they are sending large quantities to FBA [Fulfillment by Amazon]. I imagine there are some algorithmic solutions that could catch most of it too. And it wouldn't hurt to increase the size of the Brand Registry team so they can do their work faster.""  Hopkins wanted it to be known he loves Amazon as a customer and is even a shareholder, but he warned folks to take a minute to look at the seller before buying anything on Amazon and then took a final poke at its CEO Jeff Bezos.  PSA: Scam sellers are selling counterfeits of our products on Amazon. (@amazon takes their merry time to do anything about it).

In a letter to shareholders last year Bezos wrote: ""Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.""  An Amazon spokesperson responded to CNET's inquiries about the incident with the following statement:  Our customers trust that when they make a purchase through Amazon's website‚Äîeither directly from Amazon or from one of its millions of third-party sellers‚Äîthey will receive authentic products manufactured by the true manufacturer of those products. We strictly prohibit the sale of counterfeit products and invest heavily ‚Äì both funds and company energy ‚Äì to ensure our policy against the sale of such products is followed. We work closely with vendors, sellers and rights owners to strengthen protections for their brands on Amazon. Any rights owner can register with Amazon's Brand Registry service to manage and protect their brand and intellectual property rights on Amazon. In addition, we encourage rights owners who have a product authenticity concern to notify us, and we investigate any such claims thoroughly. We remove suspected counterfeit items as soon as we become aware of them, and we remove bad actors from selling on Amazon. We have successfully taken legal action against a number of bad actors and will continue to pursue legal action and work with law enforcement. In order to detect bad actors and potentially counterfeit products, we employ dedicated teams of software engineers, research scientists, program managers, and investigators to operate and continually refine our anti-counterfeiting program. When a business registers to sell products through Amazon's Marketplace, Amazon's systems scan information for signals that the business might be a bad actor, and Amazon blocks most of those bad actors during registration before they can offer any products for sale. Amazon makes significant investments in innovative machine learning and automated systems in order to anticipate and stay ahead of bad actors. On an ongoing basis, Amazon's systems also automatically and continuously scan numerous data points related to sellers, products, brands, and offers to detect activity that indicates products offered might be counterfeit. Customers are always protected by our A-to-Z guarantee, whether they make a purchase from Amazon or a third-party seller. If ever the product doesn't arrive or isn't as advertised, customers can contact our customer support for a full refund of their order.

['Jennifer Ablan'],2018-02-26 16:08:20+00:00,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Monday said the healthcare company being set up by Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) will within a year have a new chief executive officer, and set an aggressive goal to cut costs.  FILE PHOTO: Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett plays bridge during the Berkshire annual meeting weekend in Omaha, Nebraska May 3, 2015. REUTERS/Rick Wilking  Speaking on CNBC television, Buffett said ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt afford to make a mistake‚Äù in finding the right CEO to help combat spiraling healthcare costs that now account for close to 18 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, or $10,000 per person.  Buffett said it would not be difficult to ‚Äúshave‚Äù off 3 or 4 percentage points, contrasting the situation to 1960, when he said healthcare costs accounted for just 5 percent of GDP, or $170 per person.  ‚ÄúWe are at a huge competitive disadvantage in American business‚Äù relative to other industrialized countries because of the costs, Buffett said. ‚ÄúThe question is whether we can come up with something better. I‚Äôm hopeful, but don‚Äôt expect any miracles.‚Äù  Berkshire, Amazon and JPMorgan last month said they would start a healthcare venture for their workers.  While few details were provided, shares of several insurers and pharmacy benefits managers fell on the news because investors worried how the venture might disrupt the industry.  Buffett said that in starting the venture, ‚Äúwe have the perfect partnership‚Äù with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Todd Combs, an investment manager for Buffett and a JPMorgan, will spearhead Berkshire‚Äôs involvement.  WELLS FARGO  The interview occurred two days after Buffett released his shorter-than-usual annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, which had little discussion about the company‚Äôs investments.  One is Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the third-largest U.S. bank, which was surprisingly ordered this month by the Federal Reserve to curb asset growth while it tries to rebound from scandals over how it treated customers.  Buffett, whose Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate owns nearly 10 percent of Wells Fargo, on Monday said ‚ÄúI have confidence in Tim Sloan,‚Äù the bank‚Äôs CEO.  He likened the situation to 1991, when Buffett was installed as chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc amid a bond trading scandal that nearly landed that company in bankruptcy.  ‚ÄúDigging your way out of it takes time,‚Äù Buffett said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a lot to clean up.‚Äù  Buffett also discussed other means to deploy Berkshire‚Äôs $116 billion cash stake, after saying in the letter he desired one or more ‚Äúhuge‚Äù acquisitions of non-insurance businesses.  He said he would be ‚Äúmore inclined‚Äù to buy back stock than pay dividends, and might raise the repurchase threshold from 1.2 times book value. Berkshire‚Äôs stock traded at roughly 1.44 times book value based on Friday‚Äôs market close.  ‚ÄúI am fairly confident we will find ways to deploy‚Äù excess cash, Buffett said. ‚ÄúThe best chance to deploy money is when things are going down.‚Äù  Also helping Berkshire will be the recent cut in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, which gave Berkshire a one-time $29.11 billion net income boost by reducing its potential tax bill on stocks it owns.  The cut is a ‚Äúhuge tailwind‚Äù for U.S. companies and is ‚Äúreally good for Berkshire,‚Äù Buffett said.  Buffett also said that while stocks remained a better bet than bonds over the long-term, it remained ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù for ordinary investors to use margin, or borrowed cash, to load up on stocks.  He said investors might get a ‚Äúeuphoric surge‚Äù if they double their money in stocks, but would not be ‚Äúhappier.‚Äù",Buffett sets big goals for CEO of Bezos-Dimon health venture
['Berkeley Lovelace Jr.'],2018-02-26 00:00:00,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC on Monday his joint venture with Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon is going for something bigger than shaving a few percentage points off health-care costs.  Berkshire Hathaway's Buffett, Amazon's Bezos and J.P. Morgan's Dimon announced last month a venture designed to cut health costs and improve services for their U.S. employees. The three hope their companies sheer sizes will help bring the necessary scale and resources to tackle the health-care system's most pertinent issues.  ""It isn't difficult to shave a little bit off here,"" Buffett said. ""The question is whether we can come up with something better. I'm hopeful, but don't expect any miracles.""  Lowering the cost of health care and improving outcomes will be much tougher than it appears, experts say, with health spending representing 18 percent of gross domestic product and is seen as rising.  In an interview on ""Squawk Box,"" the billionaire investor said health-care spending is a ""tapeworm on the economic system."" He said the private sector can do more to lower health-care costs than the government can.  He also said the joint venture should have a ""top-notch CEO within the year,"" adding ""it has to be someone who really has a grasp on [health care] from every angle.""  ""We've got the perfect partnership with Jeff and Jamie,"" he added. ""Our companies are big, and yet we can still make things happen. We don't have bureaucratic problems or constituency problems that some others might and we like we each other. We trust each other.""  Buffett believes the problem with the U.S. health-care system is it isn't ""cost-conscious."" The system should deliver ""better care in reality and also in terms of how the people feel about the care that they're receiving,"" Buffett said.  Some analysts speculated that Berkshire's new $377 million stake in drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical could be related to his health-care cost venture.  Buffett said that would be the ""last thing on my mind,"" saying it was one of his investment deputies who bought Teva. He said the investment deputies didn't tell him and won't if they sell it.  Berkshire disclosed an 18.9 million share stake in Teva as of the end of the fourth quarter, according to the latest securities filing this month. Teva shares popped on the news of the Berkshire investment, but over the 12 months, the stock was still off more than 40 percent.  Buffett was interviewed by CNBC in Omaha, Nebraska, following Saturday's release of his highly anticipated annual letter to Berkshire shareholders.  During the interview, he also spoke on these topics:  ‚Äî When choosing between stocks and bonds 'I would choose equities in a minute'  ‚Äî I don't think Berkshire should avoid doing business with people who own guns  ‚Äî The new GOP tax law benefits Berkshire and acts as a 'huge tailwind' for businesses  ‚Äî 'We've bought more Apple than anything else' in the last year‚Äî Munger's three ways to go broke: 'liquor, ladies and leverage'","Warren Buffett: Bezos, Dimon and I aim for something bigger on health care than just shaving costs"
['Maui Hermitanio'],2018-02-22 00:00:00,"Close  The construction of the ""millennial clock"" has begun. This Long Now clock, designed to run for 10,000 years, is a symbol of multigenerational thinking.  Amazon's Jeff Bezos announced this week on Twitter that the installation of the 10,000-year clock has begun. He also posted a one-minute time lapse video of the clock's construction.  This 500-foot mechanical clock that will be built inside a mountain in West Texas is designed to run for ten millennia without any human intervention.  The clock will not track time in seconds, minutes, or hours. It is designed to tick once every year for 10,000 years.  Clock Of The Long Now  This clock has been in the works for more than three decades as a brainchild of inventor and computer scientist Danny Hillis. Hillis first conceptualized the clock in 1989. A prototype of the clock that he built in the 1990s chimed twice on the eve of New Year 1999 to symbolize the start of the new millennium. The 8-foot clock is displayed at the Science Museum in London.  The Clock of the Long Now, as it is called, is a symbol for long-term thinking. Bezos and Hillis aim for the clock to have a life span of 10,000 years or about as long as the history of human technology.  ""As I see it, humans are now technologically advanced enough that we can create not only extraordinary wonders but also civilization-scale problems. We're likely to need more long-term thinking,"" says Bezos, who has invested $42 million for the millennial clock.  The clock is designed to tick once every year, while the century hand will advance once every 100 years. A cuckoo will come at the end of the millennium.  The chime generator of the fully mechanical clock will create a different bell ringing sequence every day for 10,000 years.  ""The clock will be powered by day and night thermal cycles and will be synchronized at solar noon,"" Bezos shared on Twitter.  Mechanics Of The Clock  The Clock of the Long Now facility will be built inside a mountain in the Sierra Diablo mountains in West Texas on a land owned by Bezos that was originally intended for a Blue Origin spaceport.  The construction team is creating a series of tunnels and chambers to house the giant clock.  Five anniversary chambers will be carved into the mountain to symbolize the first, tenth, first century, first millennia, and the 10,000th anniversaries of the clock.  The chambers will also feature the solar system's planets and the Earth's moon and an exhibition of interplanetary probes in the 20th century.  ""We are providing a mechanical interface into those chambers that provides those future builders with power and the correct Clock triggering events,"" Bezos said in a post detailing the clock and its facilities.  In 2011, the Long Now Clock team has completed a 12-and-a-half-foot-diameter, 500-foot deep vertical shaft for the clock. It was also then that the team started building and testing the components of the clock.

Amazon's retail operation managed to make a profit of less than $775m last quarter on $55.3bn revenues, while the AWS cloud business was able to turn a $1.35bn net income from $5.11bn in revenues.  Amazon has also been aggressive in expanding its ranks of late, adding new workers in rapidly growing areas like the Alexa virtual assistant platform and its foray into brick-and-mortar retail with the acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods. ¬Æ  Sponsored: Unleash the potential of all-flash storage in your Data Center with Huawei",From Amazon to Ama-gone: Bezos swings the axe on hundreds at HQ

Raven was hoping Bezos might send a card.  Instead, Bezos said happy birthday via the video embedded above. Raven played the video at her mother's party on Saturday. KHOU 11 published a piece about the video Monday and Amazon provided the video to CNBC Make It.  In the video, Bezos says:  ""Hi Mrs. Barnes, it's Jeff Bezos. You were one of my favorite teachers back in elementary school. I remember you from 4th grade very well. You may not recognize me, I had more hair back then, but I sure remember you. You had a big impact on me. I heard you were turning 80. That's a big milestone! Congratulations and happy birthday. I learned a lot at River Oaks. You were definitely one of my favorite teachers. Thank you for making 4th grade so special for me and for all the other kids too. I know you've been more than 30 years as a teacher and principal. You've had a big impact on people's lives. Great teachers do change lives. We were all incredibly lucky to have you. Happy birthday, Mrs. Barnes!""  ""I need [my mom] to know that she's special, not only to me, but to all the people she touched throughout her journey,"" says Raven, speaking to KHOU 11 News. ""I'm so appreciative and so grateful and so humbled by this whole experience.""  Barnes was surprised and happy.  ""I was thrilled. I see a lot of my students in different roles, former students. Jeff is one who has been really outstanding, and I'm pleased to see him,"" says Barnes to KHOU 11. ""This has been fabulous. I didn't know all this was going on. I'm amazed to no end. I'm truly thankful and grateful.""  Bezos remembered summers in Texas in his commencement speech at Princeton in 2010. He recounted learning a lesson from his grandfather, that it is harder to be ""kind"" than it is to be ""clever.""  ""Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy ‚Äî they're given after all. Choices can be hard. You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you're not careful, and if you do, it'll probably be to the detriment of your choices,"" says Bezos in his graduation speech.  ""When you are 80 years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices,"" says Bezos.

['Sarah Berger'],2018-02-06 00:00:00,"On Monday, Feb. 5, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted, and at one moment, fell nearly 1,600 points, making it the biggest single-day point drop in history. And as U.S. stocks slipped and slid, so did the wealth of the world's richest.  The fortunes of the super-rich, like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, were hit hard on Monday. Bloomberg crunched the numbers and found that Buffett, nicknamed the ""Oracle of Omaha"" for his investing prowess, lost the most at $5.1 billion. Currently, Buffett boasts a net worth of $85 billion.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced the second biggest loss with a $3.6 billion decline in his fortune on Monday. The world's richest man ‚Äî Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ‚Äî also faced the wrath of the sinking stock market and lost $3.3 billion, leaving him with a net worth of $116 billion.  Other wealthy individuals who saw billion-dollar losses on Monday include Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who lost $2.2 billion, and Zara founder Amancio Ortega (who was at one point the world's richest person), who lost $1.2 billion, according to the index. The figures in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index are updated at the close of every trading day in New York.  Overall, 18 billionaires in the ranking lost more than $1 billion on Monday, according to Bloomberg.  Many gave away more than that in 2017  However, some of the super-rich who suffered billion-dollar losses Monday likely aren't reeling from the stock market's suffering ‚Äî many of them gave away almost as much or more in 2017.  A new report compiled by the Chronicle of Philanthropy reveals that charitable giving by the top 50 donors in the U.S. more than doubled in 2017, skyrocketing to $14.7 billion from 2016's $5.6 billion. This indicates a strong U.S. economy and that the wealthy are ""flush with cash,"" CNBC reports.  Topping the list is Bill and Melinda Gates, with a $4.8 billion donation to their namesake foundation ‚Äî that's over double what Gates lost on Feb. 5. Michel Dell and his wife Susan gave $1 billion to their own foundation, according to the list, scoring them the third spot in the ranking. In comparison, Dell lost $345 million during Monday's stock market slip.  Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan ranked second on the Philanthropy 50 list, with their donation of $2 billion, a little more than half as much as the tech entrepreneur's Monday loss.  In July, Buffett made headlines when he reportedly donated 18.6 million Class B shares of Berkshire Hathaway, then worth $3.17 billion, to five different foundations. That's also more than half of what Buffett lost on Feb. 5, according to Bloomberg's index.  But Buffett has always had a ""buy-and-hold"" attitude when it comes to times of uncertainty.  ""Don't watch the market closely,"" Buffett previously told CNBC in response to those worried about their retirement savings during wild market fluctuations in 2016. ""If they're trying to buy and sell stocks, and worry when they go down a little bit ‚Ä¶ and think they should maybe sell them when they go up, they're not going to have very good results.""","Here's how much Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos lost in the stock market plunge"
[],,"This post is part of Business Insider's ongoing series on Better Capitalism.  AOL cofounder Steve Case runs the Washington, DC-based venture capital firm Revolution, which focuses on businesses outside of Silicon Valley.  Last December, he announced that he and ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author JD Vance were overseeing a $150 million Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, with capital from high-profile investors like Jeff Bezos, Ray Dalio, Meg Whitman, the Kochs, and the Waltons.  The fund serves as a way to tap the potential of rising startup scenes across the US, build an influential network, and jump-start American cities not on the coasts.  As AOL cofounder Steve Case read author JD Vance's memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" which is about the struggles of escaping poverty in Ohio via Kentucky transplants, he saw a slice of American life he'd been trying to improve for the last several years.  Case founded his Washington, DC-based venture capital firm Revolution in 2005 with what he called a ""Rise of the Rest"" ethos: the idea that there are more places to invest in than California, New York, and Massachusetts.  These three locations - essentially Silicon Valley, Manhattan, and Cambridge - have been the country's startup centers for decades, and they have taken an increasing share of investments in the last decade, according to CB Insights. The firm reported that the states accounted for roughly 75% of all US venture capital funding from 2014-2016.  Case saw this trend in 2014 and decided to double down on one of his investing principles, resulting in the first Rise of the Rest bus tour, a four-day investing trip through the Rust Belt cities of Pittsburgh, Detroit, and Cincinnati, and then ending in Nashville, which had emerged as one of the nation's fastest-growing cities.  Each day, he'd meet with local entrepreneurs and city leaders and host a startup pitch competition in which the winner received $100,000 of his personal wealth toward a seed round.  Significant change wasn't going to come from one day in each city, but the idea was to start ongoing relationships in these communities and put a media spotlight on their business scenes.  Case and members of his Revolution team have gone on six more bus tours, establishing a network across 33 American cities. So far, Case has invested more than $3 million of his personal money during the tours, and to date, Revolution has invested more than $1 billion across its funds in companies outside of the Bay Area.  So when Case saw that ""Hillbilly Elegy"" author JD Vance was a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who wanted to help other Americans escape poverty through societal change, he saw someone who'd be a great fit for what he was trying to accomplish. He hired Vance away from Peter Thiel's Mithril firm and brought him on one of his bus tours.  In December of last year, Case and Vance announced a new chapter for their initiative with the Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, $150 million raised from themselves and 34 high-profile investors, including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, fashion label CEO Tory Burch, Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio, Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers chairman John Doerr, and the powerful Koch and Walton families.  For all involved, this is not an act of charity. This is a real chance to profit from the next billion-dollar companies that no one else is looking at. But it's also a chance to stimulate the economies of American communities that need it the most. It's about creating large-scale value over the long term.  ""So $150 million in the great scheme of things is not a huge fund - we get that,"" Case told Business Insider. ""But if we, in fact, are on average doing 10% of rounds, we're really helping catalyze, mobilize, more like $1.5 billion of capital. And then if we have this group of investors who are well positioned to write $50 million checks down the road, hopefully it ends up being many billions of capital that gets unleashed here.""  Creating a network of the country's highest-profile investors  Revolution plans on spreading that $150 million over three to four years in typical increments ranging from $100,000 to $1 million, across about 100 investments.  There will be a seventh bus tour in May, and Case said Revolution will soon announce the first batch of investments from the fund, which will be outside of the tour.  As mentioned, Case and Vance have their own money invested in the fund, and Vance is the fund's managing partner. They're joined on the Revolution side by two partners, David Hall and Anna Mason. The other 34 investors are limited partners, meaning that they have no control over how investments are made, but benefit from its potential success.  And there is the valuable networking aspect of the Rise of the Rest Seed Fund.  Regardless of how much Bezos, for example, invested, it's a relatively minuscule part of his fortune. But it offers an introduction to Revolution's specific brand of impact investing, builds a relationship with Case and Vance (an influential political figure in the US and talked-about potential senatorial candidate), and provides an entry into parts of the country with increasingly useful business opportunities.  Case sees the appeal of the fund falling into three categories:  With the vast majority of venture capital in the Valley, with NYC and Boston/Cambridge behind it, there are potentially many undervalued companies in the rest of the country, which in turns means big exits for the successful ones.  It would be an entry point into emerging communities that could lead to long-term relationships. Investors already have networks in the Bay Area and New York, but could use Rise of the Rest to start them in places like Pittsburgh and Detroit.  Making an investment that helps rising American communities has a moral component without being an act of charity.  John Doerr, one of the LPs, told Business Insider via email that startups not in the coastal hubs have their particular advantages.  ""These entrepreneurs are tackling hard problems in diverse industries, like healthcare, agriculture, logistics, and manufacturing,"" he wrote. ""There are cities between the two coasts that have unique perspectives and advantages not found in Silicon Valley or New York or Boston.""  The Rise of the Rest team is looking for these kinds of entrepreneurs, with companies that have the potential to scale on a massive level.  Pitch contest winners include green energy company PK Clean from Salt Lake City, senior care software company Lifeloop from Omaha, medical device company Sisu Global Health from Baltimore, and electronic music company Artiphon from Nashville.  Case said that his work with Revolution, including his bus tours, acted as a proof of concept for both recruiting Vance and convincing investors to join the Rise of the Rest Seed Fund. Revolution is not yet sharing details of returns, but Case said, ""given that they're early stage investments, obviously it takes some time to develop, but the performance of the initial portfolio was compelling. It was top quartile performance.""  Investing in startups to benefit entire regions  The underlying premise of Rise of the Rest is that fueling the startup scene in a struggling or recently struggling community has benefits well beyond that startup.  Case said that he saw the beneficial effects a single growing company could have on an entire region when he oversaw AOL's growth in northern Virginia in the 1990s.  James C. Dinegar, the former CEO of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, told the Washington Post in 2015 that ""AOL spawned a new generation of community involvement and investment across the region"" that continued even when the company moved its headquarters to Manhattan.  Case said he found much more data to back this up during his tenure as the chair of the Startup America Partnership in the Obama administration. ""And the data was pretty compelling, pretty overwhelming, in terms of the role startups had in terms of job creation,"" he said.  In a 2015 report on American jobs, the Kauffman Foundation found, ""New businesses account for nearly all net new job creation and almost 20 percent of gross job creation,"" and, ""Companies less than one year old have created an average of 1.5 million jobs per year over the past three decades.""  The report also noted that startups are efficient drivers of economic progress, where ""innovative and successful firms grow rapidly and become a wellspring of job and economic growth, or quickly fail and exit the market, allowing capital to be put to more productive uses.""  Case noted that when these new businesses flourish, ecosystems often grow around them, attracting more talent to the community, which then leads to new homes built.  The benefits for a highly-educated professional class are obvious, but we asked Vance how these investment projects benefit the working class, the primary focus of his book.  He said that if you, for example, invested in tech startups in Columbus, Ohio, and some of them did quite well, they would bring attention and capital to the broader central Ohio region.  Opportunities outside of Silicon Valley  And ""if you get these regional economies supercharged, it's not just good for the people who are working in the tech sector - which would typically be, you know, relatively high skilled people - it will also be good for people who live in the region that aren't necessarily working for a tech company but are benefitting from the economic dynamism that exists in tech sectors.""  For all of this to work, Case and Vance and their team can't just swoop into a city, run a pitch competition, and expect anything to happen.  ""The way I put it is, if you don't want to be an outsider to an ecosystem, don't be an outsider,"" Vance said. ""I think if you're just going in, writing a check, and not doing anything else, then you're not going to get to know the people that you need to get to know to make that ecosystem successful.""  Crystal McDonald, the founder and CEO of recruiting software company Acrew, was the winner of Rise of the Rest's New Orleans pitch competition in 2015. ""We've benefitted from and received direct mentorship from Steve Case, [Case Foundation CEO and Steve's wife] Jean Case, and multiple members of the Revolution team,"" she said.  ""The Revolution team is one of our most engaged investors,"" McDonald said.  Case and Vance make trips to each of these communities outside of the bus tours, as well. Vance has only been on one bus trip so far, but when we spoke to him, he had just returned to DC from a week-long trip that brought him to Salt Lake City and Denver.""I didn't make any investments out of that trip in Salt Lake City, but what I did was I met with a lot of people and I got to know a lot of the entrepreneurs and the investors who are working in those places,"" Vance said. ""Same thing in Denver. I just spent a day getting to know people and trying to understand what they need, what they're seeing, what they're experiencing.  ""And to me, the only way to really be a part of these ecosystems is to actually get on the ground and do the work and get to know people,"" he continued.  Vance said the bus tours are useful for drawing attention to these communities and building momentum, but that the relationships develop afterward.  The tours are also opportunities to get Revolution's partners involved. ""I was pleasantly surprised when they brought in a Google pitch coach to help us relax on stage and pitch our best,"" said Ann Arbor contest winner Shelly Sahi, founder and CEO of SAHI Cosmetics.  There's another bus tour coming up in May, destinations not yet public, and a summit in February where more than 100 regional investors will congregate in DC and discuss ways to bring more capital to their parts of the country.  Case told us that since announcing the list of LPs in the Rise of the Rest Seed Fund in December, there has been a ""quite significant level of interest among both regional investors wanting to partner with us and co-invest, as well as entrepreneurs"" who want to pitch themselves. The first investments from the fund will be announced soon.  ""So a lot going on,"" he said. ""A lot of great momentum.""",The founder of AOL and the author of 'Hillbilly Elegy' are touring the country with a $150 million seed fund for startups in overlooked American cities

"['Christina Farr', 'Getty Images']",2018-02-04 00:00:00,"CNBC: Amazon is one of your customers. Is there anything about their health benefits package that stands out from the rest of the industry, and points to their potential plans in the space?  John Doyle: Our experience is that Amazon is focused on a competitive benefits package for its employees, but we don't see anything that would be suggestive of their announcement this week. But I will say is that Amazon seems to think about the world in terms of long time periods, and when you extrapolate the current spending out into the future, it gets harder and harder to provide such great deals and convenience to consumers.  It's not too speculative to imagine that the initiative is about ensuring the sustainability of current benefits, as opposed to reducing current health costs.  CNBC: A lot of self-insured employers have talked about this ""narrow networks"" concept to reduce costs by incentivizing employees to see carefully-selected, high-quality physicians. Do you think that takes away from notions that workers should get to see whichever doctor they want? And what do you think Amazon and its partners will gravitate to?  Doyle: Well, I don't see the two things as mutually exclusive. It's important to have choice. But the issue we see a lot in health care is that choices are sometimes made that are objectively poor choices for both the employee and employer. And that's from both a cost and quality standpoint. Health care is one of the few industries where you don't always see correlation between the two.  So I think of it as using the information we can now access to curate the universe of choice but within a set of options that we know to be good for the employee and the employer. And that's by cleaving off the part off the ecosystem that is overpriced and poor quality.  CNBC: Do you think this initiative has the potential to upend health care as we know it?  Doyle: I don't want to minimize the capabilities of people like Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon, but I also don't think it makes sense to assume that success in their domains predicts a linear path to success in health. This is a very tough business. There's this notion that it's easier to disrupt if you bring in a lot of people who have never worked in health care, like technology-oriented entrepreneurs with great intentions. But I see that as missing some of the complexity and falling prey to the siren song of fixing health care. The better approach in my mind is to work with the existing players, and not against them.  CNBC: What do you think this means for Castlight, if anything?  Doyle: I was reflecting on that and I see one attribute that Bezos and Amazon have that should cause us all to take notice. It's not so much that he comes up with novel aspirations. What distinguishes him when I reflect on what he's accomplished is the uncanny sense for the adjacent possible. Castlight has been around for 10 years and we've started on some problems that were too early in terms of where data science, tech and consumer behavior actually were.  CNBC: So who ought to run this new initiative?    Doyle: I would give a call to Todd and Ed Park at Devoted Health (a venture-backed Medicare Advantage start-up). They're super deep technologists and incredibly well-respected, but also courageous. It needs to be someone with clear decision-making authority who can withstand incredible headwinds that really big interests in health care will react to when a new entity comes along.",Castlight Health CEO: Bezos will learn health care is a tough business

['Carl Velasco'],2018-02-02 00:00:00,"Close  Amazon is seeing tremendous success with its line of smart speakers and Alexa virtual assistant, as revealed in its just-released holiday-quarter earnings results. For starters, the ecommerce company reaped a revenue of $60.5 billion, way up analysts' expected $59.8 billion record.  Sales of its Amazon Web Services business are also up at $5.1 billion, slightly beating one analyst's estimate of $5 billion, but Amazon singled out one thing that was truly remarkable: its popular and market-leading Alexa assistant.  Amazon Alexa Is A Force To Be Reckoned With  ""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" said CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement. ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often ‚Äî expect us to double down.""  The CEO failed to explain exactly what the company's projections for Alexa were, and more importantly, what he meant by ""double down."" For some perspective, developers have already created tens of thousands of Alexa skills, or different voice command apps. The company has been pushing developers to create more quality ones too starting last year, when it began paying developers to build better skills.  Developers are also presently experimenting with paid Alexa apps, which might encourage them to create apps exclusive to the Alexa ecosystem and not proceed on porting them to Google Home, Amazon's chief rival in the smart speaker space.  Tens Of Millions Of Units Sold  According to Amazon's quarterly earnings, customers bought ""tens of millions of Echo devices last year,"" a strong indication that Amazon has taken over the smart home market while Google still tries to catch up. Also, with so many Echo devices populating homes, it's easy to imagine for Apple's own forthcoming HomePod speaker to have difficulty appealing to audiences.  Add to that the price difference: the cheapest Echo device is the $50 Dot, while Apple's speaker is $349. Sure, the Echo Dot is probably no match for the HomePod, but it's probably the more appealing option for those wary of smart speakers but are willing to try it. In fact, it was the top-selling product on Amazon during the holiday period.  Amazon beefed up the Echo line last year by releasing a few more models, one of which is the Spot, an alarm clock-looking Echo device that sits on the bedside table. Amazon has also inked deals with several appliance manufacturers and even car companies to feature Alexa integrations in their products.  Despite all this, it's still not clear exactly how big of an effect the Echo line has on Amazon's overall business, especially considering the company doesn't post or break down revenue from its Echo unit. It's mum about a lot of other things too, like exactly how much of its retail revenue were driven by sales made by voice commands.  It's all a big mystery, and it'll likely continue being that way, but at least Amazon is confident its Alexa business will continue dominating the smart speaker market. If ever Google pulls something off that gives it a strong push, expect fierce competition to occur ‚Äî which, as always, can only be good for consumers.

[],,"Amazon's Alexa voice assistant far exceeded the company's expectations last year, CEO Jeff Bezos said.  ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often - expect us to double down,"" Bezos said.  Alexa already has a lead on its rivals, and Amazon has been focusing on maintaining and building it.    There was a lot to like about Amazon's Street-beating holiday-quarter earnings results.  But company CEO Jeff Bezos singled out one thing in particular for praise: Amazon's popular and market-leading Alexa voice assistant.  ""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" Bezos said in the company's earnings announcement. ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often - expect us to double down.""  Bezos didn't explain what forecasts Alexa exceeded or what he meant by ""double down."" But we've already gotten some hints at what ""doubling down"" might look like.  Developers have already created some 30,000 skills, or apps, for Alexa, according to Amazon. The company has started to try to actively spur them to build more such skills and better ones.  For example, it started a program last year to pay developers to build new ones. It also started experimenting with allowing developers to charge skills users for extra features.  Recently, Amazon representatives told Business Insider that the company plans to give developers more options to charge for Alexa skills. That could encourage developers to create apps intially or exclusively for Alexa, rather than for its leading rival, Google Assistant.  Amazon already made a big push with Alexa last year, most notably by updating its lineup of Echo smart speakers, which are powered by Alexa, and releasing several new models, including the touchscreen-enabled Echo Show, the Echo Spot alarm clock, and the Echo Plus smart-home hub. The e-commerce giant also inked deals with several gadget companies, appliance manufacturers, and even automobile manufacturers to incorporate Alexa into their products. And it gave its assistant new features, including the ability to make a phone call in response to a voice command.  To be sure, it's not clear the extent to which Alexa makes a difference on Amazon's bottom line. The company doesn't break out revenue from its Echo line. It also doesn't say how much of the revenues in its retail business are driven by customers ordering through Alexa.  But it's likely Amazon's business is already benefitting from the voice assistant. Alexa makes it easier for customers to spend money with Amazon and gives them an incentive to sign up for a subscription to the company's premium streaming music services.  And Alexa could become more important to Amazon's sales and profits in the future. The company is already exploring ways to sell ads that would be spoken by Alexa.  So if Amazon is renewing its push with Alexa, you can expect more devices powered by the voice assistant, more Alexa skills and features, and likely more Alexa-compatible home appliances.  And maybe 2018 will surprise Bezos even more.  Get the latest Google stock price here.",Jeff Bezos on Amazon's Alexa: 'We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often'

New skills include content like beauty podcasts, game shows, and a quiz from the History Channel.  Alexa technology is being used in computers from companies including HP and Lenovo, and more tools have been released so third-party developers can add Alexa to their apps. Amazon Web Services also launched Alexa for Business, letting employees link it into their corporate systems for finding an open conference room, making phone calls, or managing to-do lists.

['Sam Machkovech'],,"The fact that Amazon made lots of money in 2017, both in the full year and its fiscal fourth quarter, may not surprise anybody who keeps tabs on the retailer/cloud services provider/video streamer/drone operator.  But the newsworthy thing about its latest quarterly financial report (PDF), released on Thursday, comes from comparing it to a prior earnings report from October 2017: just how bad Amazon was at predicting its bonkers Q4 income.  Amazon's October guidance predicted (PDF) an operating income not exceeding $1.65 billion for Q4 2017‚Äîa pretty sky-high estimate, considering that the company reported $1.3 billion of operating income in Q4 2016.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos added a brief statement to the report that indicated ""optimistic projections for Alexa"" being exceeded, along with a vague sales figure of ""tens of millions"" of Echo-related devices throughout all of 2017. For context, you only have to scroll down a few paragraphs in the Thursday report, which states that the company's Kindle line has sold ""tens of millions"" of devices since its November 2007 launch. That doesn't necessarily confirm that Echo devices only needed a year to reach a Kindle-like device sales count, but it certainly hints at the possibility.  Nearly half of the Q4 report is dedicated to the remarkable number of new products introduced by the AWS family in the quarter. This list includes a litany of ""machine-learning"" services, along with Amazon Rekognition Video, a video analysis service whose capabilities were teased in 2016, released in late 2017, and arguably resemble the tracking technologies employed at the company's new no-cashier Amazon Go grocery store in its headquarters city of Seattle.","Alexa, print money: Even Bezos stunned by Q4 Amazon income"

['The Editorial Board'],,"Amazon announced Tuesday that it will join with J.P. Morgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to wade into the jungle of U.S. health care, and the news slashed billions in stock-market value from health-care companies in mere hours. American health care could benefit from creative destruction, though this would be Amazon‚Äôs toughest fixer upper to date.  ‚ÄúThe ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,‚Äù said Berkshire chief Warren Buffett in Tuesday‚Äôs announcement. The companies will create an entity that ‚Äúwill provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost.‚Äù One goal appears to be to spread ideas that work.  The announcement offered no details‚Äînothing on if the companies will set up provider networks or walk-in clinics or what. But an early red flag: The press release says the group will form an ‚Äúindependent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.‚Äù  The problem with U.S. health care is not an incentive for profit, which has driven innovation and cures for diseases like hepatitis C. The fundamental problem is that the cost of a service is disconnected from underlying value. Patients don‚Äôt know the price of services and consume health care as if it‚Äôs free since government or employers are the third-party payers for most Americans.  Government spending, subsidies and regulation complicate the system and increase prices or crowd out private insurance. No doubt the profit comment was a swipe at insurers, and loathing the insurance lobby may be the only bipartisan agreement in health care. But the problem with insurers is not that they want to make money. The problem is rent-seeking‚Äîe.g., insurers supporting a government mandate for everyone to buy their product.  The speculation is that the new outfit will get into pharmaceutical delivery, which makes sense for a company like Amazon whose value proposition includes moving boxes efficiently. Another thought is that the partners will try to cut out pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate rebates on drugs and placement in formularies. The status quo is offering steep rebates against increasing list prices, which is dysfunctional and also not tied to value or outcomes.  Our advice: Go much bigger. Amazon says they‚Äôll focus on technology, and this is an area ripe with possibility, especially if the company is willing to consider some less noticed drivers of health-care costs, including chronic conditions and unnecessary visits.  Amazon could also look at start ups that are trying to deploy new technology. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has talked about how data from wearable devices could help measure clinical outcomes and inform drug development.  The new creation will represent hundreds of thousands of employees, which sounds like a lot but isn‚Äôt enough scale to change U.S. health care, and the question is how transformative this enterprise will aim to be. A brick wall of interest groups‚Äîhospitals, insurers, the AMA‚Äîwill resist any change and make Uber‚Äôs fights with taxi cartels look like minor league ball.  But health care is long overdue for a shake up, and the leaders of these companies‚ÄîMr. Buffett, Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon ‚Äîdeserve credit for jumping in. The public would be the beneficiary if this trio can figure out how to lower costs and increase quality, and the odds are better with them than another political intervention.","Mr. Bezos, Welcome to the Health-Care Jungle"

Shares of leading insurers and drug stores tanked after Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announced they would enter the insurance business.  They didn't offer many details, but investors swiftly punished traditional health care companies anyway because of fears that the new venture could disrupt the industry.  Top insurer UnitedHealth (UNH) fell 3%, helping drive a more than 300-point drop in the Dow. Two other big insurers, Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM), dropped more than 5%. Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) were each down about 3%.  Drug store giants CVS (CVS) and Walgreens (WBA) both declined more than 4%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX) plummeted nearly 7%.  The clear worry: The alliance of Buffett, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon is only the beginning of big changes for the insurance business.

Related: Bezos, Buffett and Dimon want to fix health care  In some respects, the entry of big new corporate players into health care could be more disruptive than Obamacare ever was -- or President Trump's efforts to neuter it.  But other analysts wondered whether the market was overreacting.  It's unclear just what Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), Amazon (AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) plan to offer their employees -- and how regulators will respond.  ""Considering the regulatory burden around every aspect of healthcare any new entrant in the space is at a huge disadvantage,"" Moody's vice president Mickey Chadha wrote in a report.  Big insurers, pharmacies and drug distributors ""already have large scale,"" Chadha said. That allows them to negotiate for better drug prices with pharmaceutical giants.  What's more, some of the big health care companies are getting even bigger -- and more deals could be on the way after CVS agreed last year to buy Aetna for $69 billion.  That merger has led to speculation that other insurers could be a good fit for Walgreens as well as Walmart (WMT), which operates a lucrative pharmacy business.

"['Wilfred Frost', 'John Melloy']",2018-01-30 00:00:00,"How Jamie Dimon, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett got together on health care 3:58 PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 | 01:28  The three captains of industry who just joined together to change American health care have always been close. Two decades ago, Jamie Dimon almost joined Jeff Bezos at Amazon before deciding to run Bank One instead. Both considered joining each other's boards, but did not because of potential conflicts.  Warren Buffett has long admired Bezos and lamented not owning Amazon in its early days because he didn't understand it. The Oracle of Omaha's love of Dimon's annual letters are well-known.  And all three are customers of each other.  But the initiative that was announced Tuesday turned from a casual conversation into a real effort after Berkshire Hathaway's Todd Combs joined J.P. Morgan Chase's board in September 2016, sources familiar with the situation said. That meant there was an insider to pull the group together in a formal way.  Talks about forming this partnership, which will be ""free from profit-making incentives,"" really began to pick up in pace over the last two to three months, according to sources. It was during this period when the decision was made to actually form a new company and share all health-care data with this entity.  Combs, an investment manager for Berkshire, is one of the leads on the new project along with J.P. Morgan's Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold and Amazon's Beth Galetti.  The three will soon start a search for a CEO of the company, sources said. The companies were driven to release the news before the search formally began on fear it may be leaked beforehand. A headquarters for the new company and other operational details will be announced in ""due course,"" according to a press release.  This should not be seen as a move to blow apart the health-care industry, the sources said, but rather a move to lower costs for companies like J.P. Morgan, which spends around $1.25 billion on medical benefits annually.  The group believes this initiative will one day help J.P. Morgan to lower that cost by up to 20 percent, the sources said.  Still, some Wall Street analysts who are advocating buying the tanking health insurer stocks after the news may be acting too quickly to dismiss the impact of this effort.  While there wasn't a concrete plan released for the new entity (the press release vaguely mentioned something about targeting technology solutions first), we know now that the company will have a CEO and a very real goal of lowering health-care costs for corporate America by a fifth.

How is that even possible?"" says Amazon (AMZN) CEO Bezos in a 30-second teaser ad posted to YouTube and on Twitter. The full 90-second spot will air during Sunday's game.  Alexa is the name of Amazon's artificial intelligence program. Users can talk to devices like Amazon's Echo to get updates on news and weather or control smart devices with voice commands.  The teaser advertisement opens with a woman asking Alexa for the weather. The voice starts to explain that it's 60 degrees in Austin before coughing -- an act considered so unthinkable that it's reported as a television breaking news story within the advertisement.  The teaser ends with an Amazon employee telling Bezos, ""We have the replacement, just say the word.""  ""You sure this is gonna work?"" the billionaire replies. ""Yeah,"" she says, uncertainly.  Related: Bezos and his friends want to fix health care  Fade to black. Viewers have to wait until the Super Bowl commercial to find out what's going on with the voice assistant.  Alexa has appeared in a Super Bowl ad before, in 2016 with Alec Baldwin and Missy Elliott. That's the year after Amazon introduced Alexa, delivered through its Echo devices.  Google (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL) both have voice-activated competitors. The Google Home is available for purchase and Apple HomePod is set to launch soon. Amazon Echo dominates with 61% of the market share, compared to 31% for Google Home, according to industry analysis from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.  Releasing a teaser ad is common tactic for Super Bowl advertisers to drum up buzz in a relatively low-cost way ahead of the game itself.

Earlier Tuesday, e-commerce giant Amazon, J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway announced a partnership to improve U.S. employee health care and cut health-care costs.  Details were sketchy, but the first goal will be to target technology solutions to simplify the health system.  Cramer speculated whether Bezos could come up with a pricing model for prescription drugs, charging only a $50 fee on Amazon Prime subscriptions. Prime service currently grants perks for its users, including faster shipping and access to Amazon Video.  ""Amazon Prime could make it so you pay a lot less for a lot of drugs,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street.""  Cramer cited Bezos' impact on other sectors, most notably retail.

[],,"Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan are teaming up to form an independent, nonprofit venture that'll be focused on healthcare for their US employees.  Exactly what this new company looks like remains to be seen.  This isn't the first time large employers have banded together to form healthcare companies that take on the rising cost of healthcare.    Three massive employers are forming a new company to take on the ""hungry tapeworm"" that is healthcare costs in the US.  On Tuesday, Amazon, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan said they plan to form the new venture, which will be focused on building technology solutions that will provide ""simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost"" to US-based employees and their families.  Based on how few details were in the release about what this company looks like , the stock market's reaction looks quite dramatic. The news sent healthcare stocks plummeting on Tuesday morning, especially health insurers and members of the pharmaceutical supply chain.  Piper Jaffray health services analyst Sarah James wrote that she didn't expect this new company to have a big impact on healthcare, especially given how past efforts haven't made many waves. ""Many have tried, but few have succeeded,"" she said. ""We do not expect this JV to be a meaningful disruptor to the industry, despite the stock reaction indicating that it is.""  Barclays analysts said they didn't view ""the consortium approach as the right one when we look at technology disrupting an incumbent sector,"" but added that ""we are never dismissive of anything disruptive that Amazon is involved in.""  And RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill said in a note: ""At first glance this initiative seems to have little market clout with respect to impacting healthcare costs and would not seem to have the capability to displace established players.""  For one, this isn't the first time employers have banded together in the name of lowering healthcare costs.  For example, 20 companies that cover about 4 million people formed the Health Transformation Alliance in 2016. The group has since swelled to more than 40 companies, covering 6 million lives, including Coca-Cola, American Express, and Macy's.  o improve the way corporations provide health care benefits in an effort to create better health care outcomes for their employees.""  The intent behind forming the alliance was similar to Amazon/Berkshire Hathaway/JPMorgan's: ""T  So far, that's meant a few key projects for the alliance. In March 2017, HTA announced that it was setting up a new partnership around prescription drug benefits, working with pharmacy benefit managers (companies that help negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs) to help come up with a plan that suited the alliance members. The HTA also said it'd be working to build new medical networks and using data - in partnership with IBM Watson Health - that would ideally help lower costs and improve outcomes.  Redrawing the lines of healthcare  The boundaries of the healthcare business have been changing. Instead of growing by acquiring other companies in the same business, companies have started to move into new lines of business, with no two combinations looking exactly the same.  CVS's acquisition of Aetna, for example, sent a big shockwave through the healthcare industry. The move combined the largest pharmacy in the US with the third-largest insurer in what was the biggest deal of 2017.  Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini took the new venture created by JPMorgan, Amazon, and Berkshire Hathaway as a step in a similar direction.  ""There is an unmet consumer need in health care. Individuals and families want a simple, affordable and high-quality experience that helps them stay well,"" Bertolini said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Our combination with CVS Health will help address those needs at the local level, and I am encouraged to see other companies working toward the same goal.""  And in January, a group of hospitals, including Salt Lake City-based Intermountain Healthcare, Ascension, SSM Health, and Trinity Health, along with the Department of Veterans Affairs health administration (a group that in total represents 450 hospitals) announced their plans to create a nonprofit generic drug company.  Their rationale? For years, health systems have been on the hook for skyrocketing drug prices for injections or drugs delivered through IV solutions, medications that have also been at the heart of drug shortages. The two challenges have made it harder to treat patients the way doctors want.  It's possible that the new company created by JPMorgan, Amazon, and Berkshire Hathaway will similarly redefine the way we think about healthcare, though it'll likely take a few more details to entirely figure it out. Analysts on Tuesday met the news with skepticism.  ""While we find the combination of these companies as intriguing, we do not see how the companies disrupt the healthcare status quo immediately,"" RBC's Hill said. ""We believe that the power to drive change at a rapid pace resides only in Washington, where we see little chance of regulatory directed change emerging in the near term.""",'This initiative seems to have little market clout': Wall Street's confused by the Buffett-Dimon-Bezos healthcare push

Ten percent of Amazon's Ohio workforce is on food stamps, according to a snapshot study done by a nonprofit liberal-leaning policy research group called Policy Matters Ohio. And it was released just days before Bezos' net worth broke the world record at $105 billion.  The report looked at data from the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. It found that roughly 700 employees, more than 1 in 10, at Amazon's Ohio warehouses received SNAP benefits in August.

Donald Bren, the richest real estate developer in the US, wrote a letter on behalf of his company to Jeff Bezos, offering to finance the entire $5 billion project.  Irvine, California is already home to hundreds of other top tech companies, as well as a 1,200-person Amazon outpost.  The fight for Amazon's HQ2 has reached a fever pitch.  Proposals are due on Thursday from cities across the US and Canada interested in becoming the future site of Amazon's second headquarters, and one Southern California city is taking desperate measures to clinch Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' attention.  Donald Bren, the multi-billionaire owner of the Irvine Company , wrote a letter to Bezos on behalf of his company and in companion with the city of Irvine.  In it, he offers to finance the entirety of HQ2 - which Amazon projects will cost about $5 billion - if the e-commerce giant chooses Irvine. The offer is billed by Bren as ""a one-click shopping opportunity"" for Amazon.  Bren writes:  ""With the Irvine Company proposal, Amazon will not be required to invest capital for land acquisition, buildings, or entitlements to build your new business campus. Our company has the long-term real estate assets, capital resources, and flexibility to deliver all your required workspace with lease durations of Amazon's choosing.  ""In essence, you would have a one-click shopping opportunity and be able to capitalize on our inplace property development rights, thus avoiding potential delays, because Irvine Company has invested more than 60 years master planning 93,000 acres of land, and designing and overseeing the creation of the largest new city in America‚Ä¶Irvine, California.""  Over 250,000 people live in Irvine and it's often regarded as the epicenter of Orange County, an affluent coastal community sandwiched between San Diego to the South and Los Angeles to the North.  Amazon says its new HQ2 will eventually house 50,000 mostly white-collar workers making an average of over $100,000 a year. That's currently about the average income for workers in Irvine.  Bren - who's worth a cool $17 billion - is the chairman of the Irvine Co., which owns about one-fifth of the land in Orange County spread across office, retail, and apartment space, as well as golf courses and hotel resorts.  In the letter, Bren positions Irvine as the ideal candidate for Amazon because ""Irvine is ranked by various sources as America's fastest growing, most desirable, best educated, safest, and healthiest large city,"" he writes.  More than 900 tech companies, such as Google, Broadcom, Blizzard Entertainment, UBS, and Verizon have offices in Irvine, and Amazon already has a 1,200-person outpost in the city.  Southern California is home to the biggest pool of STEM workers in the US, according to the Irvine Company proposal. The University of California, Irvine, a top-ranked public university located in Orange County, awards 42% of its undergraduate students with STEM degrees annually.  At the end of the letter, Bren makes one final plea to his fellow billionaire: ""It's 74 degrees on this beautiful October day, the sun is out and the surf's up at our spectacular beaches.

Along with Mackenzie Bezos, his wife, the couple donated the money to TheDream.US, a nonprofit group that likes to call its beneficiaries sent to college as Dreamers. According to reports, there are close to 3,000 individuals that are now in college courtesy of the scholarships being funded by other technology bigwigs.  Personalities such as Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, Bill and Melinda Gates, and Pierre and Pam Omidyar are just some of the notable benefactors.  Honoring Family History  Jeff Bezos reportedly wanted to honor his adoptive father, Miguel Bezos, who was an immigrant himself. He apparently moved to the United States from Cuba at the age of 16.

With a lot of grit and determination - and the help of some remarkable organizations in Delaware - my dad became an outstanding citizen, and he continues to give back to the country he feels blessed him in so many ways.""  Fighting For Immigrants' Rights  Several reports also document Jeff Bezos' attempts to urge the government to reinstate laws to protect the Dreamers, the undocumented immigrants whose college education is being sponsored by the nonprofit group.  The Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) is a government program that is on its way out after a controversial decision of the Trump administration last year. Now, Congress is reportedly in conflict as to what should be the government's course of action once the Dreamers are no longer protected from deportation.  Individuals who qualify are children who were brought into the country illegally before 2007 and were under the age 16 at that time. Additionally, applicants for the program should not have any serious criminal records.  Bezos, along with other executives, signed an open letter to President Trump asking the legislators to draft a law for the protection of those affected.  The World's Wealthiest  Political analysts have noted that Jeff Bezos, currently the world's richest man, announced his donation at a critical time wherein Congress and the Trump administration are at odds regarding DACA.

Fresh into the new year, his net worth jumped over $105 billion, surpassing Microsoft founder Bill Gates's $93.3 billion.  Amazon Continues To Go Up  Bezos's rising net worth is due to Amazon's growth over the last year, when it bounced almost 57 percent. This is because of Amazon's dominant performance during the online holiday season.  Amazon dwarfed other online retailers, encapsulating 89 percent of online spending among dominant holiday retailers in the five-week period starting the day after Thanksgiving Day.  Bill Gates's fortune would have been a lot higher had he not donated much of it to charity. Gates has given away 700 million shares of Microsoft, which are worth more than $60 billion along with almost $3 billion in cash.

While Amazon is where the bulk of his fortune comes from, he has also diversified into other fields.

""Richest Person In History""  Bezos is now the richest person in history according to Bloomberg. He did surpass Gates's record of $100 billion from 1999 -- but only in dollar amounts.  Gates may be currently behind Bezos in terms of net worth, but if his 1999 fortune alone was adjusted for inflation into today's value, it would be equal to $147 billion.  Even then, the title of richest person in history can be debated among other wealthy individuals through time such as John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and even Vladimir Putin. Putin's net worth may never be known since his wealth is kept private.  Fortunes can be measured by its share of national GDP. John D. Rockefeller, the first American billionaire, had his fortune in 1918 estimated to be worth $1.5 billion. Adjusted for inflation it would be worth $24 billion today. Adjusting for share of GDP, it would put him at 2 percent of the U.S. GDP at the time.  For Bezos to have a fortune worth 2 percent of U.S. GDP today, his net worth would have to jump more than three times to $350 billion. The U.S. GDP sits at over $18 trillion.

But business leaders have a message for Congress: Pass a law to save DACA Dreamers by January 18 or you will be causing US companies a lot of disruption and expense.  Over 100 of them, mostly from the tech sector, sent an open letter urging Congress to act and save them from ""disruption"" and ""significant costs.""    More than 100 business leaders signed a letter to the US Congress on Wednesday insisting that lawmakers promptly pass a law to protect Dreamers.  The letter was signed by a who's who of tech leaders including IBM CEO Ginni Rometty - who has been fervently championing this cause; Apple CEO Tim Cook; Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg; Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos; and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.  A few from outside of tech also signed the letter such as Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson, Target CEO Brian Cornell and Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky.  Dreamers are the people covered by an Obama-era program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that granted work visas to about 800,000 people brought to the US illegally as children and who were raised in the country. President Trump ended the program, wanting Congress to pass a law that provided for a permanent fix for them. He gave Congress a March deadline. After that, without a law, Dreamers could be subject to deportation.  An important deadline is nearing  Earlier this month, three former secretaries of the Department of Homeland Security warned Congress in an open letter that the law must really be passed by mid-January. This would allow enough time for implementation before the March deadline.  Trump held a public meeting with Congressional leaders on Tuesday to try and push them along but they appear to be as deadlocked as ever. Congressional Republicans don't want to fix DACA until there's a plan to build a border wall.  During that meeting, when Trump appeared willing to work on a DACA bill that didn't include a provision for the wall, some of his biggest supporters grew publicly irate at him.  Meanwhile, Democrats don't want the wall or the estimated multi-billion dollar taxpayer expense to build it, and their supporters would grow irate with them if they compromised and agreed to it.  All of this left these CEOs feeling the need to speak out and urge lawmakers to action. Many of these companies employ Dreamers.  Here's the full text of the letter (emphasis ours).  Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, and Leader Pelosi:  We write to urge Congress to act immediately and pass a permanent bipartisan legislative solution to enable Dreamers who are currently living, working, and contributing to our communities to continue doing so. The imminent termination of the DACA program is creating an impending crisis for workforces across the country.  It is critical that Congress act to pass legislation before January 19th. This window of action leaves only 45 days for implementation prior to March 5th. As a bipartisan group of former DHS secretaries recently wrote, it will take time for the agency to implement any program outlined by Congress, underscoring the absolute urgency of the January 19th deadline. In addition to causing a tremendous upheaval in the lives of DACA employees, failure to act in time will lead to businesses losing valuable talent, cause disruptions in the workforce, and will result in significant costs.  Studies by economists across the ideological spectrum have also determined that if Congress fails to act our economy could lose $215 billion in GDP.  We have seen time and again that the overwhelming majority of the American public of all political backgrounds agrees that we should protect Dreamers from deportation.  While delay or inaction will cause significant negative impact to businesses, hundreds of thousands of deserving young people across the country are counting on you to work in a bipartisan way to pass permanent legislative protection for Dreamers without further delay.","Ginni Rometty, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and other tech CEOs warn of 'significant costs' and 'disruptions' if Congress doesn't save the Dreamers by January 19"

Here's a look inside his daily routine:  Bezos is a big believer in getting enough shut-eye. He wakes up every morning naturally, without the aid of an alarm clock.‚Äã  He always starts the day by sharing a healthy breakfast with his wife, the novelist MacKenzie Bezos.

Bezos has a taste for unusual dishes.

A large part of Jeff Bezoss wealth comes from his 78.9 million shares in Amazon. The CEO also has stakes in The Washington Post and space travel company Blue Origin. While his wealth is nothing to dismiss, it actually doesn‚Äôt surpass Bill Gates‚Äô highest wealth if we take into account for inflation. The Microsoft founder had a net worth of just over $100 billion back in 1999, which would be $148 billion today.  Even if we don‚Äôt take into account for inflation, there are still a few other factors about Bill Gates that put a damper on Jeff Bezos‚Äôs net worth. This includes the charitable donations that Gates has made over the years, which have a value of $61.8 billion.

['Robert Frank'],2018-01-09 00:00:00,"Jeff Bezos' fortune has topped $105 billion, leading to a flood of headlines about the Amazon founder being ""the richest man of all time.""    By one measure, this is true. Bill Gates had been the richest man ever, with a fortune that topped $100 billion in 1999. So in simple dollar terms, Bezos is now richer. And while some say Vladimir Putin is probably richer, we have no way of knowing since his wealth is kept secret.    But wealth is all relative. In inflation-adjusted terms, and as a share of a national economy, Bezos still has a way to go to be the richest man in history.    Let's start with Gates' fortune. In 1999, he became the first person to have 11 zeros. But $100 billion isn't what it used to be. If you adjust for inflation, Gate's $100 billion fortune in 1999 would be worth about $147 billion today. So in inflation-adjusted terms, Bezos is still about $42 billion short of passing Gates.    John D. Rockefeller is often called the richest American ever, since he was the first billionaire. His fortune was estimated at $1.5 billion in 1918, which in inflation-adjusted terms would be about $24 billion today.    That doesn't sound like much. But relative to the economy, $1.5 billion meant a lot more in 1918.  Aside from adjusting for inflation, fortunes can also be measured as a share of national GDP. And by that measure, Rockefeller's fortune was the equivalent of nearly 2 percent of total U.S. economic output at the time. To have the same share today, with a U.S. GDP of over $18 trillion, Bezos would need to be worth more than $350 billion.    Historians often say that Augustus Caesar was the richest in relative economic terms, since he ran an empire that accounted for more than a quarter of the global economy at the time. And some say Caesar's fortune was equal to about 20 percent of his empire's economy. That would be the equivalent of nearly $5 trillion today.    So Bezos is the richest in pure dollar terms. But while Amazon may be out to rule the world, Bezos still has trillions to go before he can truly claim to have conquered history's rich list.",Jeff Bezos is now the richest of all time ‚Äî sort of

['Miriam Kramer'],2017-12-16 00:00:00,"When it comes to rockets, size matters, and Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos know it. The two billionaire entrepreneurs both own their own spaceflight companies.  Musk's SpaceX is currently using its large Falcon 9 rocket to fly large payloads to orbit for NASA and companies around the world, while Bezos's Blue Origin is testing out its New Shepard rocket designed to fly humans on suborbital flights to the edge of space.  Bezos and Musk have a friendly rivalry when it comes to spaceflight, having sniped at one another on Twitter about their wide and varied space accomplishments. So, at the end of the day, whose rocket is really the biggest?  When it comes to size, there's really no contest. SpaceX's Falcon 9 is a full 170 feet taller than Blue Origin's New Shepard. The Falcon 9 stands at 230 feet tall, and New Shepard comes in at a mere 60 feet.  Image: bob al-greene/mashable  That said, NASA dwarfs them both.  The Saturn V rocket that brought people to the moon for the first time stands at 363 feet tall, more than 100 feet taller than the Falcon 9 or SpaceX's next large rocket, the Falcon Heavy, set to fly its first test in January 2018.  Blue Origin's three-stage New Glenn rocket, when it's built, should rival the Saturn V. That rocket is expected to stretch to about 313 feet high.  But look, we don't want to get into some petty rocket-measuring contest.  Both Bezos and Musk's rockets have their places in the industry.  Image: bob al-greene/mashable  The truth is, the Falcon 9 and the New Shepard do two very different things. The New Shepard is designed to ferry paying customers to about 100 kilometers above the Earth before they come back down under parachutes safely within a capsule.  The Falcon 9, on the other hand brings large payloads to orbit and could one day fly humans up to the International Space Station, if all goes as planned.  That said, both the Falcon 9 and the New Shepard are designed for reusability, coming back down to Earth after flying payloads to orbit or on a suborbital journey.  As a general rule, a larger rocket like the Falcon 9 will take you farther into space, insert you into orbit, and get whatever you're trying to send into the vast unknown there with more aplomb.  That's not to say small rockets don't have their place in the industry (and in our hearts) however.  Smaller launchers, like Blue Origin's New Shepard, can be a better fit for people trying to send little payloads to orbit or the edge of space.  You don't want to waste all that fuel you'd need to launch a large rocket on something that can be launched with something smaller, right?

Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, around the same time that Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk founded SpaceX, which has billion-dollar contracts with NASA to ferry supplies to the International Space Station. Plans also call for SpaceX to deliver astronauts back and forth.  Both SpaceX and Blue Origin were self-funded by their founders. Bezos has said he sells about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company.  ""Today's flight of New Shepard was a tremendous success,"" said Bob Smith, Blue Origin chief executive in prepared remarks. ""It marks the inaugural flight of our next-generation Crew Capsule as we continue step-by-step progress in our test flight program.""  IBD'S TAKE: Bezos and Musk, along with Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen, are four billionaires using their fortunes to fulfill a passion for space exploration and tourism. The four have attracted a fleet of venture capitalists, big corporations and other investors into a private-sector space race of sorts.  Musk, when he's not running Tesla, continues to explore his dream of landing humans on Mars. In February, Musk announced that SpaceX will send two paying passengers on a one-week mission around the moon.  Startup space ventures have attracted more than $16.6 billion in investments since 2000. That money has funded 140 new companies, two-thirds of them in the last five years and most of them in the satellite business, according to research firm Bryce Space and Technology. Last year alone, $2.8 billion was pumped into 43 startup space ventures.  Amazon shares ticked down less than 0.1% to close at 1,164.13 on the stock market today. Tesla shares were down 0.6 to finish at 339.03.

['William Harwood'],,"Blue Origin, owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, launched a reusable New Shepard sub-orbital rocket from the company's west Texas launch site Tuesday, boosting an unpiloted crew capsule out of the dense lower atmosphere for a brief foray into space before a parachuted descent to Earth.  The booster, meanwhile, plunged back to the launch site tail first, re-starting its hydrogen-fueled BE-3 main engine to slow down, deploying four legs and settling to a picture-perfect touchdown on a circular landing pad.  The launching, the first using an upgraded booster and a crew capsule equipped with the large windows that will offer space tourists spectacular panoramic views, was carried out in secrecy, and Blue Origin did not acknowledge the flight until around 11 p.m. EST.  ""Successful first flight of #NewShepard today with the largest windows in space and commercial payloads on board,"" Blue Origin tweeted. ""Wholly successful mission.""  Added Bezos: ""#NewShepard had a successful first flight of Crew Capsule 2.0 today. Complete with windows and our instrumented test dummy. He had a great ride.""  Blue Origin  An edited YouTube video shows the hydrogen-fueled New Shepard rocket blasting off on a brilliant jet of flame and climbing straight away through a deep blue sky.  The crew capsule was released after the booster's engine shut down, soaring to an altitude of 322,000 feet -- about 61 miles -- before arcing back toward Earth. Small drogue chutes deployed to stabilize the spacecraft followed by three large chutes that slowed the ship for a gentle 1-mph touchdown near the launch site.  The booster, flying on its own, steered itself back to a rocket-powered touchdown, kicking up a cloud of dust as it descended to an on-target landing.  It was Blue Origin's seventh New Shepard flight overall and it's sixth success in a row. It was the company's first test flight since a dramatic launch Oct. 5, 2016, that simulated an in-flight abort and its first using a new, upgraded booster and a crew capsule equipped with windows.  Blue Origin  ""Crew Capsule 2.0 features large windows, measuring 2.4 feet wide, 3.6 feet tall,"" the company said in a caption to its YouTube video. ""(It) also included 12 commercial, research and education payloads onboard.""  Blue Origin is developing the reusable New Shepard rocket and spacecraft to carry up to six space tourists, researchers and/or experiments on brief sub-orbital flights above the discernible atmosphere more than 62 miles up, or 100 kilometers. That's the somewhat arbitrary but widely recognized ""boundary"" of space.  Once released from the booster, passengers in the relatively spacious crew cabin will experience four to five minutes of weightlessness as the spacecraft arcs over and begins falling back to Earth, enjoying a spectacular panoramic view through the largest windows ever designed for spaceflight.  Plunging back into the dense lower atmosphere, passengers will experience up to five times the pull of gravity at sea level before the parachutes deploy for landing.  Assuming continued testing goes well, Blue Origin hopes to being launching passengers within the next year-and-a-half or so.

"['Zameena Mejia', 'Getty Images']",2017-12-07 00:00:00,"During election years over the past decade, the president-elect has always scored the annual Time distinction. Last year, when Trump was named Time's Person of the Year, or ""man of the year,"" as he has said the honor should be known, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was the runner-up.  Given the ire directed at Trump by women featured as 2017's Person of the Year and the ongoing contention between the president and Clinton, this means that in both 2016 and 2017, the winner and the runner-up could be seen as adversaries, a situation that seems unparalleled in Time magazine history.  The December 18 cover story honors those who came forward with their stories of sexual harassment and spotlights over 30 victims ‚Äî a majority of them women ‚Äî who have spoken out against, and in some cases toppled, leaders across numerous industries, including Harvey Weinstein, Bill O'Reilly, Travis Kalanick and Bill Cosby.  A team of women executed the Person of the Year profile from start to finish, as Time national correspondent Charlotte Alter points out on Twitter.  On November 24, in advance of Time's annual announcement, Trump brought attention to the contest by suggesting on Twitter that he had turned down the honor.  Hours later, Time responded by noting that the president was incorrect about how the Person of the Year gets selected. In Trump's runner-up profile story, Time also states the following:  TIME had sought and tentatively secured the President's participation in an interview and photoshoot for this article. On Nov. 24, the day after Thanksgiving, he abruptly pulled out. Trump's tweet was not accurate: TIME made no assurances and placed no conditions on the outcome of our editorial decision making.  Nevertheless, as Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense In America, notes on Twitter, the stories of the ""Silence Breakers"" may not have received the recognition they have had it not been for Trump.  Time seems to concur. ""That Donald Trump could express himself that way and still be elected President is part of what stoked the rage that fueled the Women's March the day after his Inauguration,"" the profile states, referring to the ""Access Hollywood"" tape that surfaced in October 2016 featuring Trump's lewd remarks about women.  The Time writers add that Trump's actions are also ""why women seized on that crude word as the emblem of the protest that dwarfed Trump's Inauguration crowd size,"" inspiring, for example, the pink knit pussy hats.

Katie also broke some news about just who is working to pick up shares in the transaction.  Also, Uber‚Äôs financials are again loose amidst the press. I put together an overview here, in case you want to look under the hood yourself. But, the rough gist is that Uber is growing and is losing even more money than before.  Finally disembarking from Uber, Niantic raised a Series A fund-sized Series B ($200 million) to build another game. The firm, best known for its Pok√©mon Go megahit, will turn to the Harry Potter franchise next.  We then kicked over the WeWork-Meetup deal that we broke earlier in the week.

Bezos's fortune grew tremendously this year and on Thursday, registered the highest surge, accumulating $32.6 billion to his name as shown on Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the daily ranking of World's 500 richest people.

Earlier this month, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos sat down with his younger brother, Mark, for a revealing conversation at Los Angeles' Summit 2017, a conference that gathers prominent thinkers focussed on entrepreneurship. The two brothers reflected on their family, the years they spent as children in Texas, and their grandfather, who figured as a source of inspiration for both. The elder Bezos brother, who founded the online retail giant now valued at $550 billion, dished out advice for entrepreneurs and recounted several amusing anecdotes from his childhood.  Want to learn how to be resourceful? Spend your summers working on a ranch.  As a kid, Bezos spent his summers working on his grandfather's ranch in South Texas. Bezos describes his grandfather as an introspective man who was infinitely resourceful and self-reliant, two qualities which Bezos believes have vastly contributed to Amazon's success as a company.  ""The whole point of moving things forward is that you run into problems and failures,"" Bezos said. ""Things don't work, you have to back up and try again. Each time you back up and try again, you're using your resourcefulness, you're using self reliance. You're trying to invent your way out of a box.""  Inventing your way out of box, says Bezos, is largely a matter of trial and error. Bezos described how the addition of third party selling business on Amazon called Amazon Auction was unsuccessful in its early years, but through a year-and-half-long experimentation process, it eventually evolved into Amazon marketplace. ""At Amazon, we have a practice of failing,"" he said.  When it comes to setting realistic goals, think long term.  Bezos had some words of wisdom for ambitious entrepreneurs: think long term. ""Long term thinking is the lever that lets you do things that you could not do or even conceive of doing if you were thinking short term,"" he said. Bezos said that many of Amazon's competitors fail because they're fixated on accomplishing their company goals in two to three years, rather than aiming for more realistic results in five or six years down the road.  ""If everything has to work in two to three years, then that limits what you can do. If you give yourself the breathing room to take say, seven years, all of sudden you have more opportunities,"" he said.  Don't check your phone at the dinner table.  Bezos' younger brother also made a point to dispel one pervasive myth about his tech mogul sibling. Contrary to what you might believe, Bezos isn't really on his phone all that much. As it turns out, the founder of Amazon is exceptionally laser-focused. As a kid in Montessori school, Bezos describes how teachers would have to physically move his chair from one task station to the next in order to get him to focus on the next assignment. Those qualities still define Bezos as an adult: He's not a fan of checking his phone at the dinner table and he's not big on multi-tasking either, even when it comes to checking his email: ""[Multitasking] bothers me,"" Bezos said, ""If I'm reading my email, I want to be really reading my email.""

Both billionaires say they take care of their family's dirty plates and glasses every night.  In a 2014 interview with Business Insider CEO Henry Blodget, Bezos said that doing the dishes is a part of his daily routine.  ""I do the dishes every night,"" said Bezos, who's currently worth almost $95 billion. ""I'm pretty convinced it's the sexiest thing I do,"" he joked.

['Will Ashworth'],2017-11-10 08:17:48-04:00,"As investments go, there aren‚Äôt too many that have performed as well as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ). A $10,000 investment in AMZN stock a decade ago is today worth more than $250,000.  Source: Shutterstock  It‚Äôs how Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos became the world‚Äôs richest person, whose 17% ownership of the company he founded is worth $90.7 billion as I write this.  At 53 years of age, Bezos still has a lot of years ahead of him to make a difference in the world. The question is whether he‚Äôll take this incredible privilege he‚Äôs been given ‚Äî and earned I might add ‚Äî to do a lot of good.  Why Should This Matter to Investors?  Well, it shouldn‚Äôt if your only concern is accumulating substantial wealth. However, as we age, we tend to become far more introspective about the role we play in the world.  It‚Äôs possible that Jeff Bezos‚Äô legacy will forever be linked to the permanent change he‚Äôs brought to the retail industry. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, but when you have $90 billion at your disposal, the benchmark moves higher.  Anyone who believes in responsible investing will naturally be interested in what Amazon, and by association, Jeff Bezos, is doing to make the world a better place and not just a giant cash register for the company and AMZN stock.  For me, I can‚Äôt invest in a firm like Canada Goose Holdings Inc. Subordinate Voting Shares (NYSE: GOOS ), even though I‚Äôve recommended the stock on several occasions since its IPO in March, because of the way in which it procures the down and fur used in winter jackets.  It‚Äôs got a great business model and will be very successful, but I expect more from the businesses I choose to invest with, and if you have a social conscience, I believe you should too.  The Bezos Benchmark  To date, Jeff Bezos hasn‚Äôt been nearly as active as other U.S. billionaires such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Perhaps, it‚Äôs just a function of age. Bezos is nine years younger than Gates and 34 years younger than Buffett.  There‚Äôs still plenty of time to make a difference. But why wait?  ‚ÄúHe is the only one of the top five billionaires in America who has not signed the Giving Pledge, the promise created by Mr. Gates and Warren Buffett for the superrich to give away at least half of their wealth,‚Äù stated the New York Times in June. ‚ÄúHe has never appeared on the Philanthropy 50, a list of America‚Äôs 50 largest donors, that is published yearly by The Chronicle of Philanthropy.‚Äù  It‚Äôs estimated that Bezos has given approximately $100 million to charity or less than 1% of his net worth. At a time when tax cuts are going to put even more money in the Seattle billionaire‚Äôs pockets, it seems odd that he‚Äôs failed to step up, especially when you consider how much Amazon has benefited from not collecting sales taxes in the past from its customers in many U.S. states. It‚Äôs estimated to be $500 million in South Carolina alone.  Bezos and company have significantly benefited from governments looking the other way on sales taxes. It‚Äôs time he recognizes this and gives some money back to those most in need.  Amazon‚Äôs Second Headquarters  One way Bezos can do this is by going to a city that could use a leg up like Detroit or Cleveland or some other city that‚Äôs suffered under manufacturing‚Äôs demise in the Rust Belt.  I‚Äôm not demeaning either of those cities. In fact, I recently suggested three reasons Amazon and AMZN stock would benefit from opening its second headquarters in Detroit. None of them had to do with a story of hardship. Detroit‚Äôs an up and comer.  Amazon should join with Dan Gilbert and make a difference in Detroit.  Gilbert, whose personal wealth is listed at $5.8 billion, a fraction of Bezos‚Äôs, has invested $300 million buying and renovating downtown Detroit office space to encourage others to do the same.  Beyond that, Gilbert and his wife have signed the Giving Pledge and plan to give most of their wealth back to the communities of Detroit and Cleveland where they have residences.  Dan Gilbert‚Äôs just two years older than Bezos.  Bottom Line on AMZN Stock  The upside of owning AMZN stock is evident. I don‚Äôt recommend you sell AMZN stock now or anytime soon.  However, until Jeff Bezos steps up and does the right thing, I believe there will be an asterisk beside his name on the Forbes 400.  Sign the Giving Pledge. Make your employees and shareholders proud.  As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.","Still Time for Amazon.com, Inc.

Bezos says the key mindset is thinking long-term, which requires patience. He says he's used this approach repeatedly at Amazon.  ""What we're really focused on is thinking long-term, putting the customer at the center of our universe and inventing,"" Bezos says in an interview with Four Peaks TV. ""Those are the three big ideas to think long-term because a lot of invention doesn't work.""  When you're first creating something, whether it's a new business or a product, you have to invent, says Bezos. ""If you're going to invent, it means you're going to experiment, and you'll have to think long-term,"" he adds.  It can admittedly be difficult to think long-term and stay the course without panicking when things don't go your way.

[],,"Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie use Singapore math to teach their kids mathematics.  It's an approach used predominantly in South Asia.  Singapore outperformed all other countries on a worldwide math exam.    Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO and richest person in the world, has amassed his wealth by being creative and trying out unorthodox solutions to problems.  It seems he and his wife MacKenzie use the same approach for their children's education.  ""We tried all sorts of things ... Mandarin lessons, the Singapore math program, and lots of clubs and sports with other neighborhood kids,"" MacKenzie told Vogue.  Learning a second language has been proven to offer educational benefits, and team activities help to create well-adjusted kids. But what exactly is the Singapore math program MacKenzie mentioned?  Singapore math is an approach to teaching mathematics in schools called the ""mastery approach."" It's particularly prevalent in Shanghai, China, and Singapore.  Under the mastery approach, students learn a specific concept before moving on to more complex ideas, in a rigidly linear progression, Alexei Vernitski, a senior lecturer at the University of Essex, wrote in The Conversation.  When using the mastery approach in Shanghai, students aren't broken into separate groups depending on their perceived intellectual abilities. Instead, students all perform the same work at the same time before mastering and advancing to the next concept together.  By contrast, US schools teach math using the ""mindset approach,"" which aims to teach students to have a more intuitive understanding of math concepts and starts with a broader concept before breaking down a math problem into the specific steps for solving.  For example, ""A mindset-approach teacher can introduce addition via joining two heaps of cardboard counters (or other props) together, explore properties of addition via activities, and only then break the process of adding numbers into procedural steps,"" Vernitski explained.  A 2015 study of 140 schools in the UK by the UCL Institute of Education and Cambridge University found that the mastery approach improved the speed with which students learned math skills.  And on the 2015 PISA - a world-wide exam that tests 15-year-old in math, science, and reading - Singapore was the top-performing country in each subject.

The report, published Wednesday, calls attention to the wealth inequality in the United States.  The wealthiest 25 billionaires have more than $1 trillion in wealth, that's equivalent to the wealth of 56 percent of the rest of the population, or 178 million people, the report finds.  For the report, the Institute for Policy Studies used data from the most recent Forbes 400 list and the Federal Reserve's 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, the latest edition of the tri-annual data available.  Since the Forbes 400 was published, Bezos' net worth has increased another $7 billion, the authors note, so these calculations would be conservative for the present moment.

His two-pizza ruledictates that he won't call a meeting, or even attend one, if two pizzas wouldn't feed the entire group. That way, Bezos knows that the meetings he attends will be made up of only the staff most essential to the project at hand, and thus more likely to be productive.

Price‚Äôs departure was followed by the high-profile exits of head of original programming Joe Lewis and Amazon Studios‚Äôs head of unscripted programming Conrad Riggs.

Prior to those high profile departures, Bezos ordered staff to shift content away from niche, naturalistic series toward large-scale genre programming with potential for broad international appeal.

['Josh Constine'],2017-11-05 00:00:00,"Here are Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos‚Äô tips about inspiration, work-life balance, and how to be an inventor. Oh, and how it felt getting doused with champagne at his rocket landing. The world‚Äôs richest person displayed an unprecedented level of candor during an interview at invite-only getaway Summit Series in Los Angeles this weekend.  Why did Jeff get so vulnerable? Because his little brother Mark Bezos was the interviewer. Set against a backdrop of old Bezos family photos at the opulent Orpheum Theater, Jeff revealed his personal philosophy.  The final line of Jeff‚Äôs high school Valedictorian speech: ‚ÄúSpace, the final frontier. Meet me there‚Äù he said, turning Star Trek‚Äôs motto into a call to action.  How he learned resourcefulness: Jeff spent summer from age four to sixteen on an isolated farm owned by his grandfather he called ‚ÄúPop‚Äù. Without access to outside help, Pop had to rely on himself. Jeff said. Pop went as far as making his own needles and doing his own veterinary work like suturing cattle. Jeff spent a summer repairing an old piece of Caterpillar construction equipment Pop had bought for $5000 ‚Äî a huge discount because it was entirely broken. When the giant mail-order gears for the repair arrived, they were too heavy to move‚Ä¶so Pop built his own miniature crane to lift them. ‚ÄúHe would take on major projects he didn‚Äôt know how to do, and then he did them‚Äù says Jeff.  On practicing resilience: Jeff‚Äôs Pop once tore the top of his thumb off. He had tried to jump out of his moving truck and unlatch the farm‚Äôs gate before the car slid through, but the car slammed into the gate that nearly took off Pop‚Äôs finger, which was hanging on by a thread. He was so mad that he tore the top of the thumb off and threw it in the brush, then drove himself to the hospital. Rather than have his thumb stitched to his side to regrow, Pop just had the docs do a quicker skin graft from his butt. Jeff distinctly remembers how from then on ‚Äúhis thumb grew butt hair‚Äù. But rather than complain, Pop would just shave his thumb along with his face. ‚ÄúEach time you have a set back, you‚Äôre using resilience and resourcefulness, and inventing your way out of a box‚Äù says Jeff.  On raising kids: Jeff and his wife let their kids use sharp knives since they were four and soon had them wielding power tools, because if they hurt themselves, they‚Äôd learn. Jeff says his wife‚Äôs perspective is ‚ÄúI‚Äôd much rather have a kid with nine fingers than a resourceless kid.‚Äù  On choosing a romantic partner: When Jeff decided he was ready to settle down, his friends set him up on tons of blind dates. He eventually knew he‚Äôd found his wife when he met someone truly resourceful. ‚ÄúI wanted a woman who could get me out of a third-world prison‚Äù Jeff said.  How he knew to leave his job and start Amazon: Jeff had a been working in finance software engineering on Wall Street. But in 1994, he told his boss he wanted to start an Internet book store. His boss told him it was a pretty good idea but that it was ‚Äúa better idea for someone who didn‚Äôt have a good job.‚Äù Jeff took a few days, and decided ‚Äúthe best way to think about it was to project my life forward to age 80‚Äù and make the decision that ‚Äúminimized my regrets. You don‚Äôt want to be cataloguing your regrets.‚Äù And while you might feel remorse for things you did wrong, he said more often regrets stem from the ‚Äúpath not taken‚Äù like loving someone but never telling them. ‚ÄúThen it was immediately obvious‚Äù that he should leave to start Amazon. ‚ÄúIf it failed, I would be very proud when I was 80 that I tried.‚Äù  What he‚Äôd be doing if he wasn‚Äôt ‚ÄòJeff Bezos‚Äô: ‚ÄúMy best guess is I‚Äôd be a very happy software engineer‚Äù following his interest in machine learning and AI. But he admits ‚ÄúI have this fantasy of being a bartender. I pride myself on my craft cocktails.‚Äù But be warned, he says he‚Äôs extremely slow. His fantasy bar would have a sign saying ‚Äúdo you want it good or do you want it fast?‚Äù  On his personal connection to the news and owning the Washington Post: Jeff says ‚ÄúPop obsessively watched the Watergate hearings‚Äù in 1973. That might have subconsciously influenced how high he values investigative journalism, which he expressed by acquiring the Washington Post in 2013.  On the need for space travel and his rocket company Blue Origin: ‚ÄúWe have to go to space to save earth‚Äù Jeff says, noting ‚Äúwe kind of have to hurry.‚Äù Still, he believes Plan A and Plan B both need to be protecting the environment of Earth to keep it livable. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve sent robotic probes to every planet in our solar system. This one is the best.

Instead of constantly switching back and forth, Jeff says he sequentially focuses. ‚ÄúI multi-task serially.‚Äù  On how to establish work-life balance: ‚ÄúI like the phrase ‚Äòwork-life harmony'‚Äù, Jeff says. ‚ÄúBalance implies there‚Äôs a strict trade-off.‚Äù If he feels like he‚Äôs adding value and is a productive member of a team at work, ‚Äúit makes me better at home. If I‚Äôm happy at home, it makes me a better employee, a better boss.‚Äù Don‚Äôt be someone who drains energy out of their co-workers or family. He believes it‚Äôs not just about how you allocate hours in the day, but whether you have enough energy to participate with enthusiasm.  On how to be an inventor: Because the world is so complicated, you have to be a ‚Äúdomain expert‚Äù to find solutions to problems. ‚ÄúBut the danger is that once you‚Äôre a domain expert, you can be trapped by that knowledge.‚Äù You have to approach things with childlike curiosity. Inventors are the experts with beginners minds, he says.  On what defines you: ‚ÄúWe all get to choose our life stories. It‚Äôs our choices that define us, not our gifts.

[],2017-11-04 16:54:00-07:00,"Red Huber/Getty Images  Hey, Alexa, how many trips to Mars can you buy with a billion bucks?  Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos might be musing over that question this weekend, after selling more than $1 billion worth of stock in his company on Friday.  The sale came to light as the result of a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.  Amazon's stock shot up a breathtaking 13 percent on the previous Friday -- Oct. 27 -- after the company easily bested its third-quarter earnings expectations. That popped Bezos into the world's-richest-man slot, knocking out Microsoft co-founder and noted philanthropist Bill Gates. It was a return visit for Bezos; he'd briefly held the No. 1 spot back in July.  It's not clear what Bezos will do with the money from the stock sale, but in April he did say he likes to sell shares to fund his spaceship project.  ""My business model right now ... for Blue Origin is I sell about $1 billion of Amazon stock a year and I use it to invest in Blue Origin,"" Bezos said at the annual Space Symposium in Colorado, according to Bloomberg.

['Jackie Wattles'],2017-11-04 00:00:00,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the newly minted richest person in the world, just sold more than $1 billion worth of his stock.  The sale was made public in a filing posted Friday. In total, Bezos let go of one million shares for $1,097,803,365.  Exactly how Bezos plans to spend those Benjamins wasn't clear. But it isn't unprecedented for him to sell such a large chunk. In May, he sold more than a million shares. A similar sale was executed in August 2016.  Even after his most recent sell off, Bezos still personally owns about a 16% of Amazon, which he founded in 1994.  Bezos's large ownership stake helped vault him past Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire's Index.  Related: Jeff Bezos just passed Bill Gates for world's richest person  His wealth spiked last week when Amazon stock jumped 13.5% after a stellar earnings report. Thanks to the stock surge, Bezos's net worth climbed more than $10 billion to a total of more than $90 billion.  For comparison, Bill Gates is currently worth about $88 billion.  One possible destination for the cash Bezos just freed up is his commercial space company, Blue Origin. Earlier this year, Bezos told reporters at a space symposium that he sells about $1 billion per year worth of Amazon stock to fund the company, according to Reuters.  Related: Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin test fires game-changing rocket engine  Blue Origin was founded more than a decade ago, but has yet to complete its first mission. The outfit's initial goal is to send tourists to the edge of space on a sub-orbital rocket, called New Shepherd.  So far, the company has conducted only unmanned test launches. Last month, Blue Origin Chief Executive Officer Bob Smith said he expects the first manned flight to take place by April 2019.  Blue Origin may need cash for new endeavors in its pipeline.  The firm is looking to build a much larger rocket, dubbed New Glenn, that will be capable of carrying satellites into orbit. That would allow Blue Origin to compete with the likes of SpaceX and United Launch Alliance for lucrative launch contracts.  Another possible use for Bezos's cash is charity. The tech mogul said in June that he wants to start putting some cash behind philanthropic efforts, and he asked his Twitter followers for advice.  ""I'm thinking I want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now -- short term -- at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact,"" he wrote.",Jeff Bezos just sold $1.1 billion worth of Amazon stock
[],,"Vertical farming startup Plenty - which has raised $260 million to date - is opening a 100,000-square-foot farm in the greater Seattle, Washington area.  The company, which grows fruits and veggies under LEDs and without soil, hopes to sell its organic produce for the same price as traditional produce.  Plenty plans to drive down operational costs by automating its growing processes as much as possible.  Following a $200 million investment this summer - the largest agriculture-tech funding round in history - vertical farming startup Plenty is expanding beyond its Bay Area roots.  4.5 million pounds of greens annually, which is enough to feed around 183,600 Americans , according to the USDA.  The company is opening a second farm in the greater Seattle area, Plenty CEO Matt Barnard told Business Insider. Located in Kent, Washington, the 100,000-square-foot warehouse facility will grow  The new farm will officially start production in spring 2018. Instead of growing outdoors, Plenty grows its crops on glowing, LED-lit 20-foot-tall towers inside a former electronics distribution center in South San Francisco. The towers do not require soil, pesticides, or even natural sunlight.    The technique is called indoor vertical farming. It's a type of agriculture in which food grows on trays or hanging modules in a climate-controlled, indoor facility. The process allows certain types of produce to be grown year-round in small spaces.  Plenty's farm will be nearly twice the size as its original one in California. The company also has a smaller non-production facility in Wyoming, where it has tested different growing processes for over 300 crops.  The new Seattle-based farm will grow leafy greens and herbs first, but will later expand to fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, and watermelons. Barnard said that Plenty's strawberries will be smaller, less pulpy, and higher in sugar and acidity levels than the ones most consumers are used to.  Plenty is aiming to lower produce costs by automating parts of its farms  Plenty, which received organic certification earlier this year, will start selling its produce in 2018. Though the company is not ready to announce exactly how it will distribute, Barnard hinted that delivery may be an option.  To date, Plenty has raised $226 million . In July, $200 million came from a Series B funding round led by SoftBank Vision. The round included DCM Ventures as well as funds that invest on behalf of Alphabet's Eric Schmidt and Amazon's Jeff Bezos.  With the new investment, Barnard said Plenty plans to build more farms around the world. The team ultimately aims to drive down operational costs so that Plenty can sell its produce for prices that match traditionally grown fruits and veggies.  Plenty is working toward that goal by automating its farm processes ""as much as possible,"" Barnard said. For example, the company uses small robots, called the Schleppers, to transplant seedlings.  ""We grow very densely,"" Barnard said. ""And that means you get to a limit where it's hard to have a person in there.""","A new Jeff Bezos-backed warehouse farm will grow enough greens to feed 180,000 people per year"

[],,"A surge in Amazon stock on the morning of July 27 has increased CEO Jeff Bezos' net worth by $1.1 billion, officially making him the world's richest person.  Aside from displacing Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates in the top spot, the new distinction could fuel Bezos' interest in furthering human progress through for-profit companies. And those efforts could produce big shifts in how the world's wealthiest think about philanthropy.  ""I think his activities to-date suggest he looks at some of his business investments as opportunities to advance social change,"" Jane Wales, CEO of the Global Philanthropy Forum, told Business Insider.  When Amazon bought Whole Foods on June 18, the move sent the online retailer's stock skyrocketing. It also increased Bezos' net worth by $1.8 billion, to $84.6 billion. At the time that was $5 billion behind Gates. But now Bezos' total net worth of $90.9 has eclipsed that of his fellow Seattleite.  Bezos' plan to make business investments double as forms of social change was evident in his decision to buy The Washington Post in 2013. He quickly turned it into a lean, digital journalism powerhouse - something other large news organizations have struggled to do. Similarly, Amazon's recent purchase of Whole Foods may hint at Bezos' desire to reinvent the food industry's supply chain. (At the very least, he has the opportunity to do so.)  Wales says Bezos' business plays offer a window into how he could cement his status as one of the most influential players in the philanthropy world, independent of the Bezos Family Foundation that's run by his parents. In fact, Bezos may already be looking to take more projects onto his plate. Recently, he tweeted his 274,000 followers asking for ways to generate lasting impact with quick, decisive action.  ""I'm thinking about a philanthropic strategy that is the opposite of how I mostly spend my time - working on the long term,"" Bezos wrote. ""For philanthropy, I find I'm drawn to the opposite end of the spectrum: the right now.""  That approach could encourage more short-term solutions to problems typically thought of as systemic, Wales said, and that could be a good thing. She pointed to the ongoing migrant crisis as one example.  ""That requires action now. Governments are overwhelmed, and policy is not solving it,"" Wales said. ""The Bezos Family Foundation, which is mostly long-term in its thinking, is also giving to the International Rescue Committee, to Save the Children, to CARE - to organizations that address the immediate as well as the long-term.""  Other billionaires, on the other hand, are sticking to big-picture work. Bill and Melinda Gates are trying to end polio once and for all, and Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are trying to eradicate disease and improve education.  But Bezos is a newbie to the philanthropy world (he isn't involved with his parents' foundation), and people just starting out in the field often take a year or two to get a lay of the land and form a strategy. Judging by his past business moves, Bezos-style philanthropy might involve private investments in startups looking to do social good or acquisitions of other companies.  Not everyone in the philanthropy community is optimistic about Bezos' influence, however.  Larry Brilliant, the acting chairman of the Skoll Global Threats Fund, criticized Bezos' crowdsourcing approach.  ""The denominator of ideas you will get in, the vast majority of ideas which are not good, not viable, will flood this process,"" Brilliant told the New York Times.  And in a recent open letter to Bezos in Forbes, philanthropy adviser Jake Hayman took issue with the notion that focusing on short-term goals can yield lasting impact.  ""It's the business equivalent of looking for 'safe, proven investments' with imminent 10-fold returns,"" Hayman wrote. ""It doesn't happen.""  Bezos is not participating in The Giving Pledge , a pact among 16 billionaires (including Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg) to give away at least half of their fortunes before they die.  But Wales contends that Bezos still has the potential to send a strong signal to wealthy Silicon Valley types that philanthropy matters.  ""He is young, he is in the midst of his career, and he's already seen as bold,"" she said. ""What that tweet says to me is, 'I do not want to ignore today's problems.'""",Jeff Bezos is now the world's richest person - and he could redefine philanthropy
['Nicolas Chahine'],2017-10-30 10:56:58-04:00,"My thesis today is simple. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) has been the cream of the froth on Wall Street. Experts insist that it‚Äôs a bubble. I sell risk into their fears for easy profits to create income from nothing.  Source: Shutterstock  Last week, AMZN reported earnings and Wall Street absolutely loved it. The upside move was monstrous, and for a stock this size it‚Äôs mighty impressive. The critics were speechless. The report was good enough to infect most other mega-cap tech to also rally just in infectious exuberance.  Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), for example, rallied 4% on no news of its own.  Forever, the knock from Wall Street experts on AMZN has been that it runs thin margins. To that I say they are looking at this from the wrong perspective. Jeff Bezos created the ultimate startup. They have been in continuous start-up mode for over a decade. When evaluating a new company, I don‚Äôt ask them to show me profitability. They should be focused on growth.  AMZN has that in droves.    Click to Enlarge In addition, the company is profitable, so that argument still lingers on perception only, not reality. In fact, the trajectory of return-on-assets (from flat to 3.6) has been steadily rising.  Compare that to AAPL which is arguably the standard for all companies. Its ROA, though much higher than AMZN, is headed the wrong way. Its trajectory under Tim Cook has been steadily declining. It fell 45% from 2012 to 2016. So I argue that Bezos is using his money wisely to dominate new lines of business.  If equity markets don‚Äôt crash, AMZN stock is headed higher in spite of all the naysayers who keep doubting its variability. You can‚Äôt do what AMZN has been doing for decades and still be called unsustainable. Clearly it is.  So today, I am not arguing for the sake of value from the traditional sense. I am betting that the value lies in the longer-term trajectory of the stock. So I want to bet there is support in the stock price over time because enough investors believe in it like I do and they will perceive value on dips.  This is a longer-term bet which is similar to the tradition credo of ‚Äúinvesting for the long term‚Äù only using modern ways through AMZN options.  AMZN Stock Trade Idea  The Trade: Sell the AMZN June 2018 $730 put and collect $4 per contract to open. Here I have an 85% theoretical chances that price will stay above my strike so I can retain maximum gains. Otherwise, I will suffer losses below $726.  Selling naked puts carries big risk, especially for a stock as frothy as AMZN. For those who want to mitigate it, they can sell a spread instead.  The Alternate Trade: Sell the June 2018 $730/$740 AMZN credit put spread where I have about the same odds of winning but with much smaller risk. Yet the spread would yield 10% if successful.  I don‚Äôt like to chase upside prices but in this case, either of these trade setups leave room for a 30% correction in Amazon stock.  Ultimately, regardless of how careful I am, investing in stocks is fraught with danger, so I never risk more than I am willing to lose  Get my newsletter for free here.

They flew to Mexico with their parents' money to get married.  Jorgensen belonged to a unicycle troupe and worked at a retail store making $1.25 an hour, so he didn't have much money.

Net income was $256 million in the third quarter, or 52 cents per diluted share. Wall Street analysts expected the company to post revenue of $41.6 billion and EPS of 7 cents.  Jeff Bezos, Amazon‚Äôs founder and CEO, in other announcements has touted Amazon Studios projects and has taken a hands-on approach with its Hollywood ambitions. In announcing third-quarter results, he focused on the Alexa voice-enabled services and devices. Customers have purchased ‚Äútens of millions‚Äù of Alexa-enabled devices, and in the last month Amazon has rolled out five new models, Bezos noted.  ‚ÄúWith thousands of developers and hardware makers building new Alexa skills and devices, the Alexa experience will continue to get even better,‚Äù Bezos said in the Q3 release.

[],2017-10-23 00:00:00,"Amazon supremo Jeff Bezos' rocket company Blue Origin has successfully tested its main engine for the first time.  The BE-4 engine is, as the name suggests, Blue Origin's fourth generation rocket. B-1 was a wee thing that boasted 2,200 pounds of thrust. B-2 hit 31,000 pounds and B-3 reached 110,000.  The BE-4 cranks things up to 550,000 pounds from a single engine. By way of comparison, the Merlin engine used in SpaceX's rockets emit 190,000 pounds of thrust. Which is why SpaceX packs nine of them into a single Falcon 9 rocket.  Blue Origin's New Glenn rockets will put seven BE-4 engines in harness for a total 3.85 million lbs of thrust and a payload of 13 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit or 45 metric tons to low earth orbit. The Falcon 9's payloads to the same spots are 8,300kg and 22,800kg.  Here's the BE-4 in action, during a Friday test that apparently went off without a hitch.  First hotfire of our BE-4 engine is a success #GradatimFerociter pic.twitter.com/xuotdzfDjF ‚Äî Blue Origin (@blueorigin) October 19, 2017  The BE-4's first mission won't be a Blue Origin flight. Instead it's slated to power a Vulcan rocket operated by the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The company currently operates Atlas and Delta rockets, but is betting Blue Origin can power its next-generation Vulcan by 2019.  The test recorded above suggests that schedule isn't unreasonable.  Blue Origin is also working on the BE-4U, a variant of the engine for in-orbit propulsion.  All versions of the engine run a combination of liquid oxygen and liquefied natural gas, fuels that are easy to acquire and don't require inert gases to enable pressurisation. They also burn clean, which helps Blue Origin to achieve its goal of quick-and-easy re-use of its first stage rockets. ¬Æ  Sponsored: Minds Mastering Machines - Call for papers now open","Jeff Bezos fires off a blue dart, singes Elon Musk and SpaceX"

According to Amazon, the newly christened wind farm is the company's 18th solar and wind farm in the U.S., with another 35 to come.

In addition to using the engine in its own rockets, Blue Origin hopes to sell the BE- 4 to United Launch Alliance -- a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) -- for use on its new rocket series, called Vulcan.  Vulcan is the answer to an ongoing problem for ULA: Its Atlas V rocket relies on the Russian RD-180 engine, making the government wary of using the rocket for sensitive national security payloads.  ULA does have an alternative. It currently produces a rocket called Delta IV, which uses American-made engines and has frequently been used to launch payloads for the U.S. military.  But Delta IV is very expensive to manufacture -- nearly twice as expensive as SpaceX's Falcon 9 by some estimates.  ULA is looking to retire the Delta IV and begin making the new Vulcan series, which will be more competitive with SpaceX price-wise. And, taking a page out of SpaceX's playbook, Vulcan rockets will be partially reusable.  That means instead of discarding a rocket after a single launch, it'll be able to fly again and again, significantly reducing the price of a single launch.",Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin test fires game-changing rocket engine

Instead, here was Bezos on top of a turbine at Amazon's new Scurry County, Texas, wind farm, ready to christen the project open.  Sadly, his biceps were a little more covered than at Sun Valley.

Prior to local project approvals, you‚Äôll provide the public with a detailed, verified Community Impact Report regarding the project‚Äôs impacts on jobs, small businesses, housing, the treasury, the environment, and public health. You‚Äôll provide the public with ongoing, verified information regarding hiring, wages, and provision of community benefits throughout the life of the project, not just for your direct employees, but for contractors, sub-contractors, and temp agencies,‚Äù the letter states.  ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs an increasing backlash to these types of deals,‚Äù Mark Meinster, the executive director of Warehouse Workers for Justice Chicago, told VentureBeat. In talking about why his group signed the letter, he referenced the deal that the state of Wisconsin secured with Foxconn in September ‚Äî in which the state approved a nearly $3 billion incentive package in exchange for Foxconn investing $10 billion in the state. It ‚Äúreally opened a lot of people‚Äôs eyes,‚Äù he said, adding that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a history in Illinois of giving corporations a lot of money, and those corporations not living up to their promises.‚Äù  For Amazon‚Äôs part, in its RFP the company touts the direct and indirect benefits of its impact on the Seattle economy, claiming that 53,000 additional jobs were created between 2010-2016 as a result of Amazon‚Äôs direct investments.  Joseph Parilla, a Brookings Institution fellow who has researched inclusive economies, says that local politicians should see inclusivity as going hand in hand with economic growth, since inclusive economies are able to utilize more of a city‚Äôs workforce.  ‚ÄúEconomies that are suffering from economic exclusion are essentially not creating the conditions in which people can meet their productive potential,‚Äù Parilla told VentureBeat in a phone interview. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got people that want to work but are priced out of housing that is near where they can access job centers, that‚Äôs an example of exclusion that limits economic competitiveness at a regional level.‚Äù","In an open letter to Jeff Bezos, civic groups call for a more transparent Amazon HQ2 selection"
[],,"You can have the most impressive title in the world and still not be a leader.  According to the late Bill Campbell, who established a reputation as the ""coach"" of Silicon Valley, only one thing determines whether or not you're a leader: the opinions of those you're supposed to be leading.  A former Columbia University football player and coach, Campbell went on to work with and mentor with some of the biggest names in tech, including Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt.  Former Apple CEO John Sculley poached Campbell, hiring him away from Kodak to work as Apple's VP of marketing.  Sculley shared one of the best pieces of advice Campbell ever gave him: ""Your title makes you a manager. Your people will decide if you're a leader, and it's up to you to live up to that.""  Campbell himself told Sculley he'd come to that realization about leadership from working with Jobs.  ""The reality is that you have to earn leadership from the people that you're working with and who are working for you,"" Sculley told Business Insider. ""The title doesn't mean much unless you can earn their respect as a leader.""  Later in his career, Campbell served on Apple's board of directors. He went on to also become CEO of Intuit from 1994 to 1998 and eventually became the chairman of the tech company's board.  Current Intuit CEO Brad Smith said he got the same advice on leadership from Campbell, too. Sculley and Smith both said it was the best career advice they'd ever received, and that it's stuck with them ever since.  ""Basically, how you make that happen is if you believe that leadership is not about putting greatness into people, leadership is about recognizing that there's a greatness in everyone and your job is to create an environment where that greatness can emerge,"" Smith told Business Insider. ""That's our definition of leadership. We don't think leadership is the same as people management.""",Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos' mentor used a simple test to figure out who is a true leader

['Rich Smith'],2017-10-04 00:00:00,"Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos is spending $1 billion of his personal fortune every year -- and cashing in Amazon stock to do it -- as he attempts to build a rocket empire at Blue Origin. Now, it's starting to look like he might earn some of that back.  Last week, Blue Origin announced the signing of its third rocket launch customer. To be clear, these are commercial satellite launch contracts we are talking about -- not mere ""space tourism"" to the edge of space, aboard suborbital rockets, as has been previously reported.  Baby steps -- to space  Since setting up shop in Kent, Washington, in 2000, Bezos and Blue Origin have succeeded in launching and landing a suborbital rocket (called the New Shepard) multiple times. The rocket is still not ready to begin commercial operation, however (and we still don't have an ETA for when it will be). Still, once all the kinks have been worked out, the plan is to load up New Shepard with tourists, and rocket them to the edge of space for lookabouts.  Even with New Shepard yet to make its first paid tourist flight, Bezos is pushing ahead with a new project to construct a massive rocket factory in Florida. There, he proposes to churn out even bigger New Glenn rockets capable of launching satellites into space, then returning to Earth for reuse -- much like SpaceX's Elon Musk has done with his Falcon 9 rockets.  In anticipation of this capability, Blue Origin began signing up launch customers earlier this year. In March, Blue Origin announced that European satcom Eutelsat has signed on as its inaugural customer, with a flight planned in 2021. Soon after will come a series of satellites launched for OneWeb. And now, just last week, Blue Origin has announced its third customer: Thai mobile communications start-up mu Space Corporation, says Blue Origin President Robert Meyerson, will ride a Blue Origin rocket into orbit sometime early in the next decade.  Where's the rocket?  Now, it's certainly a good thing to have a big book of business at the ready and waiting to be fulfilled. But one small detail still needs to be addressed: Blue Origin hasn't yet actually built New Glenn -- nor proven itself capable of putting any rocket in orbit, for that matter.  When will this happen? Work on the Floridian rocket factory has been progressing all year long. Meyerson now thinks the factory will be ready to begin putting together the New Glenn prototype by early December.  And for that matter, where's the engine?  At the same time, Blue Origin is hard at work building the engines that will power New Glenn, the company's new BE-4 engine (which Blue Origin is incidentally also developing as the power source for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) new fleet of Vulcan rockets). Blue Origin is cranking these out at its Huntsville, Alabama, facility, and has at least three of them built already (see photo above). One of the three was damaged in testing back in May, but as the company explained at the time, this is ""not unusual during development,"" and no further mishaps have been reported since.  Curiously, Blue Origin only expects to have BE-4 fully developed and certified for spaceflight by 2019 -- in time for installation aboard the first United Launch Alliance Vulcan rocket built by Boeing and Lockheed, but nearly two full years after assembly of Blue Origin's first New Glenn begins. On the plus side, though, that means that if and when BE-4 is ready, Blue Origin should already have a rocket ready to put it to work on.",Jeff Bezos Has 3 Customers at Blue Origin -- Now He Just Needs a Rocket

['Josh Constine'],2017-09-25 00:00:00,"Product Hunt‚Äôs first employee Erik Torenberg is ready to fund fresh new startups, not just reveal them to the world. Today is the soft launch of Village Global, a seed and pre-seed early stage venture capital fund looking to connect entrepreneurs to cash as well as all-star mentors. Facebook‚Äôs Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon‚Äôs Jeff Bezos, LinkedIn‚Äôs Reid Hoffman, Google‚Äôs Eric Schmidt, Yahoo‚Äôs Marissa Mayer, and Microsoft‚Äôs Bill Gates are amongst the LPs putting money and advisorship into Village Global.  Torenberg declined to comment on this article, as VCs can‚Äôt legally discuss ongoing fundraising due to SEC rules. While the firm doesn‚Äôt list how big its fund plans to be, TechCrunch has discovered an SEC regulatory filing from June showing Village Global was targeting a $50 million fundraise. It‚Äôs unclear how much exactly it will pull in, though, as fundraising is ongoing .  So why are luminaries like former NYC mayor Mike Bloomberg, VMWare founder Diane Greene, or Disney CEO Bob Iger willing to get involved, especially when most are already outrageously wealthy? ‚ÄúThese innovators haven‚Äôt lost their love of the startup game‚Äù Village Global wrote in its launch post. ‚ÄúIn fact, they have a lot of wisdom to share about their entrepreneurial journeys, and insight to gain from interacting with the next generation of innovators.‚Äù  These tech titans may trust Village Global because of Torenberg‚Äôs grass-roots affiliation with that next generation through his work at Product Hunt. He could help CEOs far-removed from the startup trenches glean learnings about budding tech trends and business practices from Village Global‚Äôs portfolio founders.  The Village Global team also includes Ben Casnocha, who co-authored entrepreneurship strategy book The Startup Of You with Hoffman before becoming his chief of staff at LinkedIn. Other partners at Village Global include former IAC biz dev exec, 500 Startups head of investor relations, and Queensbridge partner Adam Corey; Chegg chief business officer and Harvard Business School entrepreneur-in-residence Anne Dwane; and former SuccessFactors VP and Canaan partner Ross Fubini.  Focusing on very early stage startups could allow Village Global to make an impact without raising an exceptionally huge fund, or offering expansive service arms like Andreessen Horowitz or GV (formerly Google Ventures) do in recruiting, design, and other areas. Instead, Village Global could dangle access to its network of famous advisors, roping in founders with its star power.  ‚ÄúNetworks are known for speed and adaptability. These are good attributes for founders‚Äù Village Global writes. The firm says it‚Äôs geography and vertical agnostic, and will do follow-on rounds, giving it plenty of flexibility to find who‚Äôs building the future.  Village Global‚Äôs opportunity lies in keeping its ear to the street and sniffing out high potential founders and startups before more established funds and angel investors do. At this moment, a small investment can equal a substantial equity stake.  ‚ÄúOne of the unique ways we operate is that we entrust successful angel investors and inspirational founders with capital to invest on behalf of Village‚Äù the firm explains. ‚ÄúVillage network leaders‚Äî representing different backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, geographies, and sectors ‚Äî have proximity to founders, including those who might go underestimated.‚Äù  Rather than having all deal flow and decision making go through its small core team, Village Global will develop a wider scouting network of the kind of people founders already look to for advice and first checks. These ‚Äúnetwork leaders‚Äù include YouTube‚Äôs VR lead Erin Teague, Quora vice president Sarah Smith, Dropbox‚Äôs first employee Aston Motes, and board director for Target, Hilton and [TechCrunch parent company] Verizon Mel Healey.  It‚Äôs a model that acknowledges that startup returns are binary ‚Äî they either become failures or huge successes with little in between that‚Äôs meaningful to investors. By being generous with how it distributes rights to the returns on its investments to scouts, Village Global could gain access to these breakout deals that can pay back an entire fund.

['Ruth Umoh'],2017-09-21 00:00:00,"As a kid, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos learned an important lesson from his grandfather: Kindness is just as important as intelligence in order to be successful.  Bezos, who was briefly the richest person in the world, learned this lesson one summer when spending time with his grandparents on their Texas ranch when he was ten years old. The self-made billionaire, who Forbes estimates is worth $82.6 billion, recounted the story during baccalaureate remarks he made at Princeton University.  As a child, he said he was obsessed with math and would find any reason to show off his prowess with numbers. He would calculate everything, including gas mileage, useless statistics and grocery spending.  One day, while sitting in the back of his grandparents' car, he overheard an ad on the radio, which said that every puff of a cigarette takes minutes off your total lifespan.  Bezos said his grandmother was a smoker, which he hated, so he decided to calculate the number of years she had taken off her life thus far.  ""I estimated the number of cigarettes per days, estimated the number of puffs per cigarette and so on,"" Bezos told the graduating class.  ""When I was satisfied‚Ä¶I poked my head into the front of the car, tapped my grandmother on the shoulder and proudly proclaimed, 'At two minutes per puff, you've taken nine years off your life!'"" he explained.  Bezos sat expectantly as he waited to be applauded for his wit and ""arithmetic skills."" Instead, he said, his grandmother burst into tears.  His grandfather pulled over to the side of the road, got out of the car and waited for his grandson to exit the vehicle, Bezos recalls. He then told him, ""Jeff, one day you'll understand that it's harder to be kind than clever.""  Bezos told the Princeton grads that there is a difference between using gifts, such as intelligence, and making choices in life. ""Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice,"" said Bezos. Although being smart comes in handy, kindness is invaluable to achieving your career goals, he says.  He left the graduates with these final thoughts: ""Gifts are easy ‚Äî they're given after all. Choices can be hard. You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you're not careful, and if you do, it'll probably be to the detriment of your choices.""  Like this story?

[],,"Last week, Amazon announced that it will solicit bids from North American cities to be home to the company's second headquarters, expecting to eventually house as many as 50,000 employees in this location.  But as U.S. cities scramble to outbid one another in their effort to lure Amazon, they're failing to consider one distinct possibility: Bezos called for bids in North America.  Amazon already has a big presence in Montreal and has been ramping up its Toronto presence over the past year. We've recently seen the likes of Google and Uber open significant global research outposts in Toronto, so it would come as no surprise if Amazon followed suit.  As a global businessman, Jeff Bezos is setting his sights far beyond the US. Here are the key reasons he should pick Toronto to house Amazon's next HQ.  Toronto checks Bezos' boxes  Amazon is seeking a city of more than 1 million people with an international airport, mass transit, an educated workforce and a solid business climate with notable job growth. Toronto easily meets all of these criteria.  Not only is Toronto ranked the fourth largest city, and third largest tech cluster in North America, but it is also the third best city to live and work in the world.    The city's booming population benefits from quality transportation and infrastructure: Toronto boasts two international airports, a hyper-connected public transit system, and a global distribution network via its vast waterfront. Amazon has requested a whopping one hundred acres to build its HQ - a size that few U.S. cities could accommodate. Toronto, however, could house Amazon on its waterfront, a central urban location with global shipping access.  Beyond urban infrastructure, Amazon could benefit from Toronto's highly educated workforce. Not only is the city home to the University of Toronto - a globally ranked university with nearly 90,000 students - but also retains 17 other leading research institutions within the greater Toronto area. These organizations feed directly into local businesses and corporates, which are celebrating ""remarkably strong"" job growth. And Amazon - seeking 50,000 employees not just from tech, but also marketing, fulfillment, and other industries - will have an educated and engaged talent pool to hire from.  But these basic criteria are table stakes, and many US cities will meet Amazon's standards. What sets Toronto apart are its diverse culture, strong government support, and thriving tech community.  Canada's diversity represents Amazon's global business  After saturating the U.S. market (with an estimated 64% of U.S. households paying for Prime memberships) Amazon has set its sights on global expansion.  And no city better represents a global company with an international customer base than Toronto.  Toronto has been named the most diverse city in the world, and is a cultural haven for fresh foreign talent. As Trump's harsh immigration policies drive tech workers out of the U.S., Trudeau is luring the world's best and brightest to Canada with his open immigration policies. In fact, Canada's expedited work permit program is bringing tech talent to Toronto in record numbers.  Bezos has openly criticized Trump's stance on immigration and is seeking an inclusive workforce and policies that protect his employees. No U.S. city can offer Bezos that stability, and with Trump actively threatening Amazon, Bezos is likely to expand northward to ensure access to top talent while gaining a stronger foothold internationally.  Toronto tech is on the rise  But perhaps most appealing to Amazon is Toronto's booming technology sector. As Trump slashes the budget for innovation, Trudeau is actively supporting it - committing billions of the federal budget to build Canada's tech industry.  And Toronto is seeing the benefits. The city added 22,500 new tech jobs in the last two years - more than New York City and Silicon Valley combined. Amazon could fit right into Toronto's thriving tech ecosystem - which is home to over 4,000 active tech startups, the world's largest innovation hub, and home-grown successes like Slack and Shopify.

[],,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has ordered a major TV strategy overhaul at Amazon Studios, according to Variety  Over the past few days, two shows related to F. Scott Fitzgerald - ""The Last Tycoon"" and ""Z: The Beginning of Everything"" - abruptly got the ax. And Bezos reportedly wants the team to focus on getting a big-time drama hit like ""Game of Thrones.""  While these cancellations might seem to come out of nowhere, there was actually a public sign earlier this year that Bezos personally disagreed with the execs running Amazon Studios. In a letter to shareholders in April, Bezos used an anecdote about the TV division to illustrate a point about a philosophy he called ""disagree and commit.""  Here's what Bezos wrote:  ""We recently greenlit a particular Amazon Studios original. I told the team my view: debatable whether it would be interesting enough, complicated to produce, the business terms aren't that good, and we have lots of other opportunities. They had a completely different opinion and wanted to go ahead. I wrote back right away with 'I disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing we've ever made.' Consider how much slower this decision cycle would have been if the team had actually had to convince me rather than simply get my commitment.""  Bezos described the incident as a ""genuine disagreement of opinion, a candid expression of my view, a chance for the team to weigh my view, and a quick, sincere commitment to go their way."" He ended that section of the letter by praising the team for bringing home ""11 Emmys, 6 Golden Globes, and 3 Oscars,"" and adding in a self-deprecating joke (""I'm just glad they let me in the room at all!"").  But now it seems Bezos might be taking a firmer stance, and perhaps is coming around to the position that maybe he was right all along.  Sources told Variety that there is some internal frustration with Amazon's original TV output. While the tech giant has had success with the critics - with shows like Golden Globe winners ""Transparent"" and ""Mozart in the Jungle"" - it has yet to land a must-see drama like ""Game of Thrones.""  ""We've been looking at the data for some time, and as a team we're increasingly focused on the impact of the biggest shows,"" Amazon Studios head Roy Price told Variety. ""It's pretty evident that it takes big shows to move the needle.""  And Bezos is watching.",CEO Jeff Bezos has ordered big changes at Amazon's TV division - but he gave a sign he disagreed with its strategy months ago

The cancellation comes as part of a mandate from the leadership in Seattle.  ""We've been looking at the data for some time, and as a team we're increasingly focused on the impact of the biggest shows,"" Amazon Studios head Roy Price told Variety . ""It's pretty evident that it takes big shows to move the needle.""  Price pointed to Amazon Prime Video hits like ""Man in the High Castle,"" and car series ""The Grand Tour"" (from the ""Top Gear"" team), as examples of what Amazon is looking for. He also mentioned ""Game of Thrones.""  ""I do think 'Game of Thrones' is to TV as 'Jaws' and 'Star Wars' was to the movies of the 1970s,"" Price said. ""It'll inspire a lot of people. Everybody wants a big hit and certainly that's the show of the moment in terms of being a model for a hit.""  This isn't the first time Amazon Studios execs have talked about focusing on big shows.

"['Cynthia Littleton Daniel Holloway', 'Cynthia Littleton', 'Daniel Holloway']",2017-09-09 02:04:03+00:00,"The mandate from Jeff Bezos is clear: Bring me ‚ÄúGame of Thrones.‚Äù  That‚Äôs the word that has the creative community buzzing this week about a major strategy shift underway for Amazon Studios‚Äô original series efforts.  The CEO of the e-commerce giant is said to have tasked Amazon Studios chief Roy Price with honing the focus on high-end drama series with global appeal. Amazon‚Äôs decision this week to scrap plans for a second season of period drama ‚ÄúZ: The Beginning of Everything‚Äù reflects the new marching orders.  On Friday, Amazon confirmed five new projects ‚Äî series greenlights for a period drama from Paul Attanasio and Wong Kar-wai and a comedy starring Fred Armisen and Maya Rudolph; two comedy pilots; and a Seth Rogen-produced comic book adaptation eyed as a straight-to-series order ‚Äî that reflect the drive to find shows that deliver sizzle in the water-cooler environs of social media and can travel around the world.  In an interview on Friday, Price told Variety that there is a new focus on finding ‚Äúbig shows that can make the biggest difference around the world‚Äù in growing Amazon Video‚Äôs reach and Amazon Prime subscribers. ‚ÄúTong Wars,‚Äù the drama penned by Paul Attanasio and directed by Wong, is a prime example of a period piece that blends the epic history of Chinese immigration to the U.S. with a crime potboiler. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very compelling show,‚Äù he said.  Related Amazon Orders Fred Armisen-Maya Rudolph Comedy, Wong Kar-wai Drama, 3 Other Projects (EXCLUSIVE)  Price said the strategic course has been informed by the wealth of data available to Amazon and is the consensus of senior management, including Bezos.  ‚ÄúIt comes out of analysis of the data and conversations among the leadership team,‚Äù Price said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been looking at the data for some time, and as a team we‚Äôre increasingly focused on the impact of the biggest shows. It‚Äôs pretty evident that it takes big shows to move the needle.‚Äù  Price cited Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúMan in the High Castle,‚Äù the unscripted ‚ÄúGrand Tour,‚Äù and the new comedy ‚ÄúThe Tick‚Äù as examples of existing shows that fit the bill of having global appeal. And he doesn‚Äôt mince words about his interest in finding a show that packs the wallop of HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúGame of Thrones.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI do think ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô is to TV as ‚ÄòJaws‚Äô and ‚ÄòStar Wars‚Äô was to the movies of the 1970s,‚Äù Price said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll inspire a lot of people. Everybody wants a big hit and certainly that‚Äôs the show of the moment in terms of being a model for a hit.‚Äù  Price pointed to the move Amazon made in January to recruit former Fox International Channels exec Sharon Tal Yguado to lead a new event series development unit focused specifically on sci-fi, fantasy and genre series. Price pointed to AMC‚Äôs ‚ÄúPreacher‚Äù and Starz‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican Gods,‚Äù shows that Amazon carries in multiple markets outside the U.S.  ‚ÄúThe biggest shows make the biggest difference around the world,‚Äù Price said. ‚ÄúIf you have one of the top five or 10 shows in the marketplace, it means your show is more valuable because it drives conversations and it drive subscriptions. ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre a mass-market brand. We have a lot of video customers and we need shows that move the needle at a high level.‚Äù  With this focus, Amazon could not justify moving ahead with season 2 of ‚ÄúZ.‚Äù Industry sources said Karl Gajdusek, the showrunner recruited to steer season 2 of ‚ÄúZ,‚Äù was plainly told of the shift in strategy when the surprise call came down on Thursday that the show was being shuttered. Gajdusek and his team of writers had been working for several weeks on getting the 10-episode order ready for production. ‚ÄúZ‚Äù starred Christina Ricci as Zelda Fitzgerald, the socialite wife of writer F. Scott Fitzgerald and a legendary figure from 1920s Jazz Age lore.  Price said the decision on ‚ÄúZ‚Äù came down to a simple matter of priorities. He notes that Amazon has an ongoing development pact on the film side with Killer Films, one of the show‚Äôs producers.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre glad we did ‚ÄòZ.‚Äô We‚Äôre proud of the work done on it and the team we had on it,‚Äù Price said. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day you only have so many slots. With those slots you have to drive viewership and drive subscriptions. Sometimes there are shows that are a little bit on the bubble in terms of their viewership. We went down the road with it but ultimately decided in light of the full spectrum of opportunities we were looking at we would not be able to proceed with the show.‚Äù  Amazon is also expected to cut a significant number of current development prospects off of its plate. The service already has several big-ticket series orders in the works for 2018, including the two-season order for Amy Sherman-Palladino‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,‚Äù the John Krasinski-led adaptation of Tom Clancy‚Äôs ‚ÄúJack Ryan‚Äù from Carlton Cuse, Matthew Weiner‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Romanoffs‚Äù anthology series, and David O. Russell‚Äôs untitled crime drama starring Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore.  Multiple industry sources who work with Amazon say it is clear there is pressure on Price and his team to deliver. There has been speculation about the prospect of major management changes at Amazon Studios given the number of industry insiders who have complained about what they see has a difficult working environment at the streaming giant.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a good sign when Seattle overrules your decision,‚Äù said one prominent producer of Amazon‚Äôs reversal on ‚ÄúZ.‚Äù  The overhaul of priorities comes amid what sources said is some frustration with the fruits of its foray into original TV content during the past few years. Amazon Studios made an early splash with comedy ‚ÄúTransparent‚Äù in 2014, which helped propel the national conversation about transgender issues and has collected high-profile Emmy wins for star Jeffrey Tambor and creator Jill Soloway.  But Amazon hasn‚Äôt had much traction in pop culture with many other original series, even after comedy ‚ÄúMozart in the Jungle‚Äù was an underdog winner for comedy series at the 2016 Golden Globe Awards. For all of Amazon‚Äôs investment in original series, it‚Äôs been eclipsed this season by its smaller rival Hulu with the critically praised ‚ÄúThe Handmaid‚Äôs Tale.‚Äù  There‚Äôs been speculation about Amazon reining in its development expenditures ‚Äî something that Price flatly denies. Amazon‚Äôs aggregate spending on original content will be up in 2018 versus this year, he said, although he would not cite specific dollar figures. He also noted that Amazon is shelling out big bucks this season for a marquee sports franchise, ‚ÄúThursday Night Football.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very interested in getting those top shows ‚Äî something that is broadly popular and admired,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe want to allocate a lot of our attention and resources going forward to that kind of thing.‚Äù  There have already been signals of Amazon‚Äôs heightened focus on event and spectacle series. Tal Yguado has been given ample resources to go after big-name talent. In August, she secured an overall deal with ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù creator Robert Kirkman, luring him away from his longtime home AMC. At Fox, Tal Yguado made the savvy decision to help finance and license ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù for the more than 200 Fox-branded international channels. She also worked with Kirkman in developing ‚ÄúOutcast,‚Äù which airs across the Fox international channels group and on Cinemax in the U.S. She is said to be targeting other ‚ÄúWalking Dead‚Äù talent to make the jump to Amazon.  Tal Yguado came to the streaming service three months after the development team under Price had been reorganized, with comedy head Joe Lewis taking oversight of half-hour and drama series development. The move has caused some confusion among TV literary agents, who see no clear lines between Lewis‚Äô team and Tal Yguado‚Äôs event focus.  Amazon faced another black eye in the creative community this week when reports of strife behind the scenes on another drama series, ‚ÄúGoliath,‚Äù emerged along with the news of the show‚Äôs third showrunner in two seasons. Clyde Phillips, who took over from creator David E. Kelley for season two, departed the show of his own volition after creative conflicts with star Billy Bob Thornton.  ‚ÄúGoliath‚Äù was in production in Los Angeles on its episode five of the 10-episode order at the point when Phillips left last month, according to sources. Lawrence Trilling, a producer on the first season of ‚ÄúGoliath,‚Äù has taken over.  Price said he spoke with Thornton on Thursday and was feeling ‚Äúvery hopeful‚Äù about the future of the show. He also asserted that Amazon has not had a higher incidence of behind-the-scenes changes on shows than other networks doing comparable volume.  ‚ÄúThe reality is it can be a complicated task to create a show. and sometimes it goes smoothly and other times it does not,‚Äù Price said.  As for the big-picture of Amazon‚Äôs programming focus, Price said there are more deals to be unveiled in the coming weeks that will make the company‚Äôs priorities very clear to the creative community. ‚ÄúThere are a lot more big, exciting announcements to come, and you‚Äôll see where it‚Äôs all going,‚Äù he said.",Jeff Bezos Mandates Programming Shift at Amazon Studios (EXCLUSIVE)

The mail-order retail giant said on Thursday that the ""HQ2"" facility, wherever it may land, would host up to 50,000 employees and serve as the secondary base of operations to its existing Seattle headquarters.  Amazon is looking to spend up to $5bn of its own money to get the new campus built, though it is also hoping the host city will be ""creative"" about helping to secure the real estate.

"['James Fontanella-Khan', 'Anna Nicolaou', 'Anne-Sylvaine Chassany', 'Getty Images']",2017-09-05 00:00:00,"The announcement that Amazon was to take over Whole Foods Market sent a shudder of fear through many other retailers, but news of how the deal came about has given those retailers hope.  Hope that they might be next.  Bankers report an upsurge in requests from their retail clients asking that they put a call in to see if Amazon would be interested in acquiring them, too.  At the same time, investors, analysts and consulting firms have engaged in an elaborate guessing game about which targets might be on the radar of Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos now that the king of US ecommerce has shown himself interested in bricks and mortar stores.  The calls to mergers and acquisitions bankers have ratcheted up this summer, according to more than five advisers who were contacted by clients. Requests that bankers put out feelers to Amazon have come from apparel, grocery and convenience store companies, they say.  ""Everything is Amazon these days,"" says a senior consumer and retail banker in New York, who asked not to be named as they are not authorised to talk about clients to the media.  While unconventional, the idea of reaching out to a single potential buyer proved a winning strategy for Whole Foods.  The company's executives, under pressure from activist investors, called Amazon after they spotted a media report suggesting the online retailer had considered buying their company. John Mackey, Whole Foods' chief executive, described the months leading to Amazon's $13.7bn offer as a ""whirlwind romance"".  ""All these desperate retail companies think that the solution to their problems will be solved by Bezos . . . they are all praying for a new 'Amazonian' era of retail . . . in which they are members of the [Bezos] club,"" says another banker.  Amazon declined to comment for this story.  Before Whole Foods, Amazon's financial bets were smaller. The Seattle-based ecommerce giant has made about 130 acquisitions or investments since its debut in 1995, in a wide range of industries from books and music to cloud computing. Its largest acquisition until this year was Twitch, a site where millions of regular visitors watch other people play video games, for $970m in 2014.  Analysts are also speculating about which companies Mr Bezos might target next.  Aaron Turner, analyst at Wedbush Securities, says the company could buy GrubHub, the fast-growing US food delivery start-up, to move further into food and create a ""dominant force in restaurant delivery"".  ""This is not imminent by any means,"" he cautions. ""But clearly [Amazon] is laser-focused on food, specifically perishable food."" Mr Turner says Amazon could buy GrubHub for about $4.5bn, giving it a network of 50,000 restaurants and nearly 9m active diners.  Other analysts have, at various points, tipped big box retailers such as Bed Bath & Beyond or Target that could help Amazon build out a physical store network.  And higher-end or speciality retailers such as Nordstrom, Warby Parker, or Lowe's would be good options, says Jeff Glueck from Foursquare, the location app, who studies store foot traffic patterns.  Nordstrom shoppers are twice as likely as the average person to shop at Whole Foods, says Mr Glueck, while Warby Parker, the trendy eyewear retailer, would help capture coveted millennial consumers, he says.  The interest in Amazon comes as traditional retail and consumer companies are grappling with enormous changes in how people shop and what they want to buy. US department store sales have dropped 18 per cent since 2010, according to Bank of America estimates, while PwC expects at least 90m sq ft of retail space will be closed this year.    Amazon has been rumoured as a white knight for underperforming retailers in the past, although several of the bankers contacted by clients are pushing back. Their advice has been instead to focus on improving margins by restructuring the business or cutting costs by merging with rivals, rather than banking on the idea of Amazon saving them.  ""Amazon is on its own path and will not just keep on buying for the sake of it,"" says a banker working in the retail sector. ""Historically they have been deal shy and anyone thinking that they will be saved from Amazon is wrong.""  And some industry veterans are cautious too. ""Jeff thinks differently than us,"" says a senior executive at one of the largest US grocers. ""I think he'll be doing something completely different.""

['Matthew Lynley'],2017-09-03 00:00:00,"The benefits of Amazon‚Äôs $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods more or less went live this week, with price cuts out the wazoo as well as a bunch of Amazon Echo devices available for sale in stores. With this massive move into grocery chains and the obvious branding play, as well as tangential benefits like suddenly getting access to hundreds of locations with fresh ingredients that may or may not go into meal-kit delivery, it‚Äôs time to start asking: where won‚Äôt Amazon go?  I‚Äôll take a crack at something that wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise if it‚Äôs flying around the office in Seattle: whether or not Amazon should buy one of the increasingly popular coffee start-ups that‚Äôs attracted a lot of venture financing.  To kick things off, just imagine that for every Starbucks or Peet‚Äôs there‚Äôs a Blue Bottle or Philz across the street. Those coffee shops have a brand that‚Äôs not associated grabbing your latte and jumping out. They are, instead, focused more on some sense of the art of good coffee (as weird as that sounds) and they have an opportunity to capture a higher-value customer. Now, grow that vision to the thousands of Starbucks coffee shops around the world along with the resources that Amazon could potentially pour into it with carte blanche from Wall Street.  And, there are so many options to choose from. Just walk down Valencia street in San Francisco (or, if you aren‚Äôt in this wild hipster bubble, do some googling) and you‚Äôll see far too many options from which to choose. Most have raised some kind of venture financing: Blue Bottle raised $70 million a few years ago; Philz did a $45 million financing round last year. There are other coffee providers like Ritual Coffee, Four Barrel and Sightglass, all of which goes to show that there is an insatiable taste for unique experiences. All of these seem to be growing with new stores coming in every so often (including the periodic VERY Apple Store-esque Blue Bottle) and this coffee craze doesn‚Äôt seem to be going anywhere.  Starbucks in its most-recent operating quarter also posted an 18.4% operating margin as it continued to add hundreds of new stores. That means for every billion dollars in revenue, it‚Äôs minting hundreds of millions of dollars in a profit that it can drive directly into new stores and growth. But Starbucks, as a public company, is beholden to its shareholders and might not have the same luxury or room that Amazon has to gleefully burn cash and still charge toward being a trillion-dollar company.  Looking at the slash line for this company, Starbucks has built a very impressive business built on top of a very impressive brand, not to mention the tech to order ahead to run in and immediately grab a semi-decent iced latte. It‚Äôs also shown a euphoric willingness to expand into the latest trends of coffee, with fresh cold brew options or an alarming number of flavor syrups for your typical espresso drink:  While most of these coffee start-ups seem very popular in select markets, and the Whole Foods business was definitely more mature than any of these startups, the grocery chain was still really a strong millennial brand going up against traditional grocers like Safeway or Kroger. Still, just given how many companies there are, and how much money they have raised, it would seem there‚Äôs quite a bit of room for all of these to grow on their own and remain independent.  Buying a coffee chain would be a classic Amazon move: find a market that represents the opportunity to expand the Amazon brand and then bulldoze into it with reckless abandon. It can then apply the overwhelming scale it has to both supply the kinds of weekly or bi-weekly subscriptions these shops have while embedding free awareness of the Amazon brand within those coffee shops. There‚Äôs a risk of diluting the super-hipster high-value brand of Philz or Blue Bottle, but given that Amazon is a Very Great Tech Company, that seems almost unlikely.  Amazon is probably done pulling out the checkbook for a while. And yet, to buy Whole Foods, Amazon said it would make a debt offering in order to get enough capital to pull it off. This isn‚Äôt a super-uncommon practice as big companies look to do big acquisitions, and it seems like Amazon could easily pull off some financial gymnastics to shell out the required cash to pick up one of the many, many coffee start-ups out there.  Also, all of the above are pretty delicious and would be even greater if they weren‚Äôt quite as expensive. But, that‚Äôs none of my business",Jeff Bezos should totally buy a coffee startup

The three companies will start a new company with the goal of improving health care for their U.S. employees.  So beyond health care, what else is in the Bezos portfolio? His empire encompasses not just e-commerce, but also news organizations, robotics companies and coupon sites. Oh, and ever heard of Google, Airbnb or Uber? Bezos is an investor in those companies, too.  Here is a snapshot of his empire, as compiled by Visual Capitalist:  Bezos has made the acquisitions through a variety of vehicles. Amazon has made its own acquisitions, including the recent $13.7 billion deal for Whole Foods , as well as other companies such as online shoe retailer Zappos and video streaming site Twitch.  Amazon has also made investments in smaller startups. In 2010 and 2011, the company heavily invested in coupon company Living Social, which was eventually acquired by Groupon in 2016. Whole Foods wouldn‚Äôt be Amazon‚Äôs first foray into food; the company invested $100 million in grocery delivery service HomeGrocer back in 1999. That company eventually folded during the dot-com bust.  Then there‚Äôs Bezos Expeditions, which manages Jeff Bezos‚Äô venture capital investments. Those investments have included Twitter , Workday , Business Insider and Stack Overflow.  Bezos also invests his money on a personal level. He was an angel investor in Google , having invested $1 million in the company in 1998. He also invested $112 million in Airbnb and $37 million in Uber.  And finally, there‚Äôs Nash Holdings, a private company owned by Bezos, which bought The Washington Post in August 2013 for $250 million.  Oh, and don‚Äôt forget that Bezos, like Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, has his sights on expanding his empire to space. Bezos is the founder of Blue Origin, a rocket company that could start offering trips for paying customers to space by 2018. Bezos said in some years he has personally invested up to $1 billion in the company.  As Bezos expands his empire, he generally just keeps getting richer. When Amazon‚Äôs stock surged after news hit of the Amazon and Whole Foods deal, Bezos became a whopping $1.88 billion richer ‚Äî that‚Äôs $600 million more than what the top 10 Whole Foods shareholders combined are making on their Whole Foods stock.","All the companies in Jeff Bezos‚Äôs empire, in one (large) chart"

As noted by the eagle-eyed property gossip at the L.A. Times who first sussed out the transaction the newly purchased property was not listed on the open market so details are slim. Tax records, however, indicate the unassuming, 4,568-square-foot single-story residence, located on a prime, pine tree-lined street just north of Sunset Boulevard and south of Coldwater Canyon, sits on about half of an acre and was built in 1956 with four bedrooms and six bathrooms. The property includes a double-gated semi-circular drive and a swimming pool set into an expansive concrete terrace ringed by a thick wall of mature trees and foliage.  Mister Bezo‚Äôs larger property, once owned by David Geffen and squirreled down a long driveway behind an imposing gate shrouded in a towering grove of bamboo, spans just over two landscaped acres and includes a sprawling mansion, a swimming pool and a sunken tennis court. Presumably the property has been substantially improved and altered over the last decade, but at the time of his 2007 purchase the 11,891-square-foot California Spanish residence had four en suite family bedrooms plus a two-bedroom staff suite and a total of six bathrooms. A separate, self-contained guesthouse added another bedroom and bathroom. The Bezos estate now horseshoes around a third property that is not currently owned by the tech and retail tycoon but that no one would be even a teensy bit surprised if he eventually, and sooner probably rather than later, also acquired.

Since the late 1990s the Bezos family have made their primary home in the moneyed Seattle suburb of Medina where in 1998 they shelled out $10 million for a roughly 5.5-acre waterfront estate on the pristine, mansion-lined shore of Lake Washington. A deep dive into property records suggests the couple subsequently acquired several neighboring properties that brought their vast, park-like compound to well over ten acres with multiple residences and several docks and boathouses.  In the fall of 1999 the Bezos were reported to have paid powerhouse music executive Tommy Mottola $7.65 million for three contiguous apartments located on two high floors of the iconic, Art Deco-style Century building on New York City‚Äôs Central Park West. Together the three units span just over 4,400-square-feet and property records show that in May of 2012 the same corporate entity used to purchase the three units from Mister Mottola coughed up another $5.3 million for a neighboring unit, sold by late filmmaker Otto Preminger‚Äôs niece Eve Preminger, that brought the combined size of the Bezos‚Äô holdings in the prestigious, twin-towered apartment house to a smidgen below 6,200-square-feet.  Though he bought the venerable Washington Post newspaper in 2013 for around $250 million, the Bezoses did not buy a home in the nation‚Äôs capital until late 2016 and it was the newspaper he owns that in early 2017 identified Mister Bezos as the mysterious buyer who shelled out $23 million ‚Äî in cash, natch ‚Äî for a titanic, two-mansion complex in the diplomat packed and, hence, heavily secured Kalorama neighborhood. Barak and Michelle Obama first rented and then paid $8.1 million for a mansion in the leafy neighborhood where, just around the corner, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump pay a reported $15,000 per month for a not quite 7,000-square-foot residence designed in the early 1920s by illustrious D.C. architect Waddy Butler Wood.  Sandwiched between the embassy of Myanmar and The President Woodrow Wilson House, where the 28th president moved after he left the White House in 1921 and live until his death in 1924 ‚Äî Wilson‚Äôs wife, Edith, remained in residence until her death in 1961 at which point the house and its contents were bequeathed to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Bezoses colossal D.C. complex comprises two stately if awkwardly conjoined historic mansions that together total almost 27,000-square-feet and that for almost 90 years, until 2013, housed the The Textile Museum. The smaller of the two residences, a three-story red brick Georgian, was designed and built in 1912 by John Russell Pope, architect of the Jefferson Memorial, and the larger, built around the same time, was designed by architect Waddy Butler Wood. Both homes are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the Bezos have reportedly engaged the services of the prominent architecture firm Barnes Vanze to oversee a substantial restoration and renovation to convert the former museum into what will be D.C.‚Äôs largest private home.",Jeff Bezos Makes Off-Market Purchase of House Next Door to Beverly Hills Estate

A common quarterly complaint from shareholders of public companies is how richly valued success stories like Netflix, Amazon, Salesforce and Tesla can fail to turn a profit. But often, especially in the early days of new companies, losing money is part of the plan.  Some of these companies have the ability to go back to the capital markets for more cash, as Elon Musk has done multiple times. Many of these tech companies also have long-term, institutional shareholders who buy into the CEOs' grand plan and are willing to ride out the ups and downs in quarterly financials.  Amazon, now a mature technology giant but long known for not worrying about short-term financials, last week announced a 77 percent decline in second-quarter profit as it invests heavily in video content and global expansion. There are some advantages the big guys get that don't apply equally to all business ventures, especially outside the tech sector. Few banks are going to give a small business the amount of running room stock investors have given Amazon and Tesla. And private business owners are more likely to be forced into a sale of their own equity than find a way to hold on when times get tough.  But there are good reasons for a healthy business to lose money. It falls under the general theme, especially early on, of investing for the long run. The recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey found that when asked to cite critical issues, business owners, especially younger ones, put customer demand ahead of any costs. And the youngest subset of owners ‚Äî those under age 35 ‚Äî are the most confident about current business conditions. Both private and public sources of capital understand that losing money is a known path to success and will work with promising companies that aren't quite at profitability.

This is the bear case for Target, Walmart, Kroger, AutoZone, O'Reilly, HD Supply, Fastenal, W.W. Grainger, Michaels, Dollar General and Dollar Tree - just to name a handful...  Amazon is paying a huge premium to the current market price for a business where its strategy will be to slash its profitability for the foreseeable future in order to grow market share.

And that quite likely will not change again immediately: On Thursday afternoon Amazon unveiled its quarterly earnings results, reporting a steep fall in profits and a rise in spending. The company‚Äôs stock declined in after-hours trading.  Of course, being only the second-richest person in the world is not exactly the worst place to be for Mr. Bezos.

"['Sally French', 'Social Media Editor', 'Drone Reporter']",,"Amazon AMZN, +0.30% founder Jeff Bezos has disrupted a huge variety of industries, including retail, newspapers, e-commerce and more. And his latest mission? Fixing health care.  Amazon announced today that it is partnering with Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, -0.44% and JPMorgan Chase JPM, -0.25% to get into the health care business. The three companies will start a new company with the goal of improving health care for their U.S. employees.  So beyond health care, what else is in the Bezos portfolio? His empire encompasses not just e-commerce, but also news organizations, robotics companies and coupon sites. Oh, and ever heard of Google, Airbnb or Uber? Bezos is an investor in those companies, too.  Here is a snapshot of his empire, as compiled by Visual Capitalist:  Bezos has made the acquisitions through a variety of vehicles. Amazon has made its own acquisitions, including the recent $13.7 billion deal for Whole Foods , as well as other companies such as online shoe retailer Zappos and video streaming site Twitch.  Amazon has also made investments in smaller startups. In 2010 and 2011, the company heavily invested in coupon company Living Social, which was eventually acquired by Groupon in 2016. Whole Foods wouldn‚Äôt be Amazon‚Äôs first foray into food; the company invested $100 million in grocery delivery service HomeGrocer back in 1999. That company eventually folded during the dot-com bust.  Then there‚Äôs Bezos Expeditions, which manages Jeff Bezos‚Äô venture capital investments. Those investments have included Twitter , Workday , Business Insider and Stack Overflow.  Bezos also invests his money on a personal level. He was an angel investor in Google , having invested $1 million in the company in 1998. He also invested $112 million in Airbnb and $37 million in Uber.  And finally, there‚Äôs Nash Holdings, a private company owned by Bezos, which bought The Washington Post in August 2013 for $250 million.  Oh, and don‚Äôt forget that Bezos, like Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, has his sights on expanding his empire to space. Bezos is the founder of Blue Origin, a rocket company that could start offering trips for paying customers to space by 2018. Bezos said in some years he has personally invested up to $1 billion in the company.  As Bezos expands his empire, he generally just keeps getting richer. When Amazon‚Äôs stock surged after news hit of the Amazon and Whole Foods deal, Bezos became a whopping $1.88 billion richer ‚Äî that‚Äôs $600 million more than what the top 10 Whole Foods shareholders combined are making on their Whole Foods stock.","All the companies in Jeff Bezos‚Äôs empire, in one (large) chart"
[],,"Jeff Bezos may be $910.7 billion away from becoming the world's first trillionaire, but research suggests he's closer than some might think.  A recent Oxfam report on wealth and inequality, entitled ""An economy for the 99%,"" found super-rich people like Bezos, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett have seen their wealth collectively grow by huge margins over the last decade. Within the next 25 years, Bezos' wealth could jump like never seen before.  According to Oxfam's report, there were 793 billionaires worldwide in 2009. Added up, their net worths totaled $2.4 trillion. By 2016, the richest 793 people maintained net worths of $5 trillion - an annual growth of 11%.  ""If these returns continue, it is quite possible that we could see the world's first trillionaire within 25 years,"" the report stated.  In other words, Oxfam estimates that if trends hold, Bezos - whose momentary net worth of $92.3 billion briefly led the pack on Bloomberg's Billionaire Index on Thursday, before Gates reclaimed the top spot - could stand alone on future lists of ""The World's Trillionaires.""  The question that remains is whether either of the two men will try to keep increasing their wealth or put a chunk of it toward philanthropic efforts. Gates, at least, doesn't seem to want the ""world's first trillionaire"" distinction. Since leaving Microsoft in 2006, he has devoted his time and resources to eradicating infectious disease and improving education worldwide through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  In partnership with Warren Buffett, Gates and his wife have created the Giving Pledge for other billionaires who want to help public causes by giving away part or most of their fortunes.  Bezos, meanwhile, has made no such commitments. He hasn't signed the Giving Pledge and doesn't involve himself with the Bezos Family Foundation, which his parents run. Recently, he made an open call on Twitter for ways to make lasting impact through short-term philanthropy, but he hasn't announced that he'll be pursuing any particular ideas.  Bezos' greatest efforts to create social change have come through his business ventures. It was evident in his buying The Washington Post in 2013, as he quickly turned it into a lean, digital journalism powerhouse - something other large news organizations have struggled to do. Similarly, Amazons agreement to buy Whole Foods may hint at Bezos' desire to reinvent the food industry's supply chain. (At the very least, he has the opportunity to do so.)  As Oxfam suggests, Bezos may beat Gates in the race to 13 digits because wealth is incredibly hard to shrink once someone is so rich that spending is no longer an option. It's doubly easier for someone like Bezos, who is still actively trying to grow richer.  ""The super-rich can achieve returns that are not available to the ordinary saver,"" the report stated, ""helping the gap to grow between the wealthy and everyone else.""",Jeff Bezos could be the world's first trillionaire by 2042
['Carl Velasco'],2017-07-28 00:00:00,"Close  Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, the world's largest and most significant online retailer, managed to beat Microsoft founder Bill Gates as the richest person in the world. But only for several hours.  Jeff Bezos Wins And Loses 'World's Richest Person' Title In A Span Of Hours  An uptick in Amazon shares on Thursday morning, July 27, in advance of Amazon's earnings report briefly catapulted Bezos past Gates, making him $1.5 billion overnight. After its shares climbed as high as $1,083.31, which gave Bezos $92.3 billion in net worth, shares fell 0.7 percent to $1,046 four hours later.  Now, Bezos has climbed back down to the second spot, behind Bill Gates again, according to Forbes' billionaires list. That list often fluctuates, presumably because some of the people at the top have net worths not that far apart. For instance, Gates now has $89.8 billion, while Bezos hovers extremely close with $88.7 billion. The next guy on the list, Spanish business tycoon Amancio Ortega, has $83.5 billion.  Though Bezos comes close, Gates's could actually have far, far more riches if it weren't for his philanthropic endeavors, Forbes notes. He has given away $31.1 billion of his wealth over the course of his lifetime up to the end of 2016; who knows how much that number has increased now that we've come midway through 2017?  Amazon: A Success Story  The wealth of Bezos, meanwhile, mostly comes from the notable success of Amazon, which has grown to become not only a massive online retailer, but also a smart device company; a crucial investor of space exploration with Blue Origin; and even a content creator, thanks to its Amazon Video platform that hosts original shows and films.  Amazon's humble beginnings started with book sales, then it expanded to CDs, toys, electronics, and now probably anything money can buy, you can buy from Amazon ‚Äî and have it delivered quick.  Amazon nearly made $136 billion in revenue last year, with the company now valued at $500 billion ‚Äî an unimaginable feat of growth from what started as a book retailer. It also helps that unlike other companies with steep valuations, Amazon has stood the test of time because it has crossed ""fad"" territory and became a category unto itself ‚Äî simply put, Amazon has defined ""online shopping"" for years now, and it likely won't stop defining and redefining it anytime soon.  For now, however, Bezos needs to sit behind Gates, still ‚Äî but as the then-Microsoft-now-turned-philanthropic-firebrand pours more money into charity, Bezos certainly stands a chance at the top seat, though if he even wants the coveted chair remains a question.

[],,"On Thursday, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos became the richest man in the world  When Amazon's earnings missed expectations and its stock fell later that day, Bezos was dethroned by Bill Gates. As of Friday, Bezos holds the not-too-shabby title of second-wealthiest man in the world, with a net worth of $85.9 billion.  One potential key to Bezos' success is that he minimizes the amount of meetings he takes.  He's said he meets with Amazon investors for just six hours ... a year. And he avoids early-morning meetings at all costs.  One of Bezos' more creative strategies for not losing entire days to unnecessary meetings is the ""two pizza rule.""  It's simple. The more people you pack into the meeting, the less productive the meeting will likely be. The solution? Never have a meeting where two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group.  Whether you work at Amazon or another company, gathering together a massive squad for your meeting will probably just stifle creativity. In Fast Company, Rachel Gillett writes that ""the idea of working within small teams is believed to help diminish various innovation killers like groupthink and social loafing.""  And as Business Insider's Rich Feloni reports, other ingredients for a solid meeting include appointing a strong moderator, setting firm ground rules, and ensuring the discussion is relevant to all attendees beforehand.  What's more, writing for Psychology Today, Dr. Adrian Furnham, a professor of psychology at University College London, says that it always helps to manage expectations for meetings.  ""Always plan and circulate an agenda before the meetings,"" he writes . ""Get everyone to agree beforehand what the outcomes of the meeting are to be. Take charge of the agenda and the outcomes. Be clear why some are, and are not, on it. Give some idea of the length of the meeting.""  While the gist of Bezos' rule is that less is more when it comes to meetings, you can also feel free to take his advice literally and bring two pizzas to your meetings every once and a while. Pizza makes everything better.",The 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest men

['Jack Schofield'],,"Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos was briefly the world's richest man today when Amazon's share price surged just ahead of the company's quarterly results.  When they peaked at $1,083.31, Bezos was worth $92.3 billion, which put him ahead of Bill Gates's $90.8 billion fortune. Bloomberg promptly reported: Jeff Bezos Surpasses Bill Gates as World's Richest Person.  However, Bezos slipped behind Gates when the share price retreated about four hours later, and he's now worth only $89.3 billion.  Gates has generally been the world's richest man for decades, thanks to the value of his share of Microsoft. He has been overtaken from time to time -- once by Oracle's Larry Ellison -- but never put under sustained pressure.  However, it's reasonably safe to predict that Gates will finally hand over the poisoned chalice to his fellow Seattle billionaire.  There are two reasons to think this will happen. First, Gates has spent the past decade being a philanthropist, and he's already given away $31 billion. If he hadn't, Bezos wouldn't even be close. Second, Gates isn't benefiting from Microsoft's booming stock price, because he's no longer a major shareholder. Even Steve Ballmer owns more shares than Bill.  How long Bezos might keep the top spot is much harder to judge.  Bezos's rise to riches has been short and sharp, and the result of the rapid rise in the value of Amazon shares. According to CNBC, Bezos's ""net worth has grown by $70 billion over the past five years, surging by $45 billion in the last two years alone -- possibly the largest wealth-creation surge in history.""  A decade ago, Bezos was only worth $4.4 billion.  A bear might suggest that Amazon is a bubble stock and that its share price isn't justified by the company's sales and profits. A market ""correction"" would see Bezos plunge down Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.  A bull would note that Amazon only operates in a small number of countries, that it still doesn't carry a full range of products, and that there are still lots of retail sales for Amazon to cannibalize.  Amazon still has enormous growth potential inside the USA. It has enormous growth potential in China and India, where it is a relative newcomer. It has enormous growth potential in more than 180 countries where it doesn't have local subsidiaries. These include Spain and Portugal, all the Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland), all of South America except Brazil, plus all of Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  If Bezos stumbles, then Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg could take the top spot. His net worth has grown by $22.5 billion in the past year to $72.5 billion. (Mind you, it fell by $2 billion today.)  Given the stunning performance of Alphabet/Google, Larry Page ($47.5 billion) and Sergey Brin ($46.4 billion) are also tips for the top.  They're just outside the Top 10 at the moment, but as Bezos's example shows, things can change dramatically in technology.","Amazon's Jeff Bezos was, for a day, the world's richest man"

Today, the Amazon CEO surpassed Bill Gates as the richest person on Earth, for a few hours at least.  Bezos's net worth topped $90 billion on Thursday morning, allowing the Amazon founder and CEO to dethrone Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft (MSFT), as the richest man in the world, according to Forbes and Bloomberg.  However, an afternoon dip in Amazon's stock price caused Bezos to slip back behind Gates, who has been No. 1 since 2013 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bezos finished the day worth $88.8 billion, just behind the $89.8 billion for Gates.  What's a billion dollars between the world's richest guys anyway?  Bezos has been hailed as the smartest guy in business for turning a bookselling platform into a disruptive force that has flipped traditional retail on its head.  His world's-richest-man milestone was made possible because of Amazon (AMZN)'s surging stock price. The e-commerce juggernaut's market value surpassed $500 billion this week for the first time ever.  The vast majority of the Bezos fortune is tied up in Amazon stock, of which the CEO owns nearly 17%. That stake alone is worth $83 billion, meaning Bezos could just as quickly lose his new title as the world's richest man should Amazon's stock decline, or Microsoft's value rise.  In recent years, Bezos's fortune has whizzed past that of legendary investor Warren Buffett, Spanish retail magnate Amancio Ortega and Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim.

Related: Jeff Bezos is the smartest guy in business  Bezos founded Amazon in the mid-1990s from a garage, originally as an online bookseller.

Amazon reported its second quarter earnings today, showing a profit of just $197 million on strong sales of $38 billion. The dip in profit, a drop of 77 percent from $857 million this time a year ago, is mainly due to Amazon‚Äôs aggressive investments in its own business.  It does mean, however, that Bezos‚Äô personal fortune, given his roughly 80 million shares in Amazon, will take a sizable enough hit to keep him from climbing back to the top. Bezos was already back at second place at the time of market close today, but strong enough earnings would have clinched him the crown going into tomorrow.

The one area that will be interesting to watch is cloud computing. That‚Äôs where Amazon and Microsoft are both fiercely competing with one each other to win over businesses that are increasingly looking to the cloud for hosting and computationally intensive tasks like training and operating artificial intelligence software. In that realm, Amazon Web Services, the company‚Äôs cloud platform, continues to make impressive gains.

The company appears to once again be squeezing out a very small profit on top of its mammoth retail operations, and that will only face more pressure as it looks to wrap up that deal and gain control of hundreds of retail outlets across the country.  The drag here is that Amazon is offering a big range in its income that goes into the red ‚Äî projecting anywhere from a loss of $400 million to a profit of $300 million. The company has had a nice stretch of profitability even as it spends aggressively on growth, but it appears that might come to an end next quarter. It‚Äôs a signal that Amazon may be going back into burn mode as it starts to expand, especially with the acquisition of Whole Foods.  The company‚Äôs shares have seen a meteoric rise this year, as shares have risen almost 40 percent since the beginning of the year. That huge rise led to Bezos overtaking Bill Gates as the richest person in the world, a sort of iconic passing of the torch as Amazon has become the interface between online retail and operations and the physical world. Amazon has continued to bust into new areas like voice recognition with Alexa, video streaming with Twitch ‚Äî and now physical retail operations with Whole Foods.  Once again, AWS is carrying the lion‚Äôs share of the load here as it posted an operating income of $916 million ‚Äî up from $718 million in the second quarter a year ago. Amazon‚Äôs net income this quarter was $197 million, down from $857 million in the second quarter a year ago. The company‚Äôs server operations have Amazon‚Äôs operating margin and, if you look pretty closely at the amount of profit the company is able to spit out, it‚Äôs pretty close to AWS ‚Äî which is now on track to be a business that generates more than $10 billion a year.  Amazon reported earnings of 40 cents per share on revenue of $38 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.42 per share on revenue of $37.18 billion. That revenue is still up 25 percent year-over-year compared to the second quarter in 2016.  All that being said, AWS is still growing at around the same rate as it was last year. The company said its AWS sales rose 42 percent in the second quarter year-over-year. That‚Äôs down from 58 percent comparing the second quarter between 2015 and 2016. Any growth here is, of course, good growth as AWS is a critical piece of infrastructure for many companies around the world ‚Äî and it spits out a very healthy operating profit on a regular basis.  That part of the business is, of course, going to face increasing competition as Google looks to ramp up its cloud efforts. Microsoft is also an ever-present challenger here, and while AWS is largely synonymous with the rise of cloud computing, it‚Äôs a utility that still has to keep up with the demands of startups and companies around the world.",Jeff Bezos‚Äô brief stint as world‚Äôs richest human ends with Amazon‚Äôs second-quarter whiff

That is, they would be, if not for one simple fact: you are not the world's wealthiest person. I am.  That's right, Mr. Bezos, all of your billions ($90.6 of them, according to Forbes) pale in comparison to MY wealth. You see, Jeff, I am rich in love for my family, and the profundity of that love far surpasses your bank accounts.  Also, I run a global criminal drug empire worth more than $300 billion.  Sorry, Jeff! Your spot at the top of the world's wealthiest list is unfortunately meaningless! Even with all your money, profit and influence, you'll never match how truly rich I feel each and every day of my life when I walk into my home and am greeted by my sweet young daughter Alise, my beautiful wife Shannon, and my 75 personal bodyguards armed to the teeth to protect me and all of my drugs 24/7.  Your wealth pales in comparison to MY riches: a profound love for my family and also my drug empire worth $300 billion.  Of course, I'm sure you're feeling good today, thinking about where you started and how far you've come along on your journey to becoming the world's wealthiest man. Your passion for your business is very admirable. But mark my words, Mr. Bezos: some day soon you will look around and know that your $90.6 billion is chump change ‚Äî a hollow, meager number meaning nothing ‚Äî when stacked up against the swell of love in my heart when my daughter says, ""Goodnight Daddy, I love you,"" or my right hand, J√ºrgen, tells me, ""We have defeated the cartel. You now control all of North America's major drug routes.""  I wouldn't trade a second with my incredible family for all the money in your bank account, sir. I also wouldn't trade it for my own bank account, which has much more money than that in it (because of the drugs).  This beautiful moment is worth more than your entire net worth. Literally. I keep $92 billion in the lining of the couch I am sitting on. The money is from drugs. Image: Shutterstock / Dragon Images  If you're interested in being truly wealthy, Mr. Bezos, I do have some advice for you:  Make time for family dinners. Don't put work first. Don't force everything into a schedule. Be spontaneous. Take a break! Kill your competitors using paid assassins, and then kill those assassins to cover your tracks. Invent a really bad drug and sell it for a lot of money.  Taking a walk with your family is the best investment you can make, Jeff. Besides paying off police forces so you can run drugs between countries without profit loss, that is. Image: Shutterstock / Dragon Images  Remember: being wealthy on paper is less of a blessing than it is a curse, my friend. Be careful it doesn't make you lose sight of what really matters: your incredible family. Also it is bad for me because the IRS will see my drug money and I will go to jail for a long time, possibly forever.  Thanks for reading Mashable Humor: original comedy every day. Or most days.

His biological dad, Ted Jorgensen, met and started dating his mother, Jacklyn Gise, when they were both in high school. Jorgensen was 18 and Gise was 16 when she became pregnant. They flew to Mexico with their parents' money to get married.  Jorgensen belonged to a unicycle troupe and worked at a retail store making $1.25 an hour, so he didn't have much money. He was also ""had a habit of drinking too much,"" according to ""The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,"" by journalist and biographer Brad Stone. When Jeff Bezos was 17 months old, his mom divorced Jorgensen.  In 1968, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos, who arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba knowing only one word of English: ""hamburger."" Jorgensen agreed to let Bezos adopt his son and, at 4 years old, Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen became Jeffrey Preston Bezos.  Biographer Stone suggests that Bezos' childhood may have contributed to his obsession with success. ""It is of course unknowable whether the unusual circumstances of his birth helped to create that fecund entrepreneurial mix of intelligence, ambition, and a relentless need to prove himself. Two other technology icons, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, were adopted, and the experience is thought by some to have given each a powerful motivation to succeed,"" Stone writes.",Amazon's Jeff Bezos: son of a teen mom to richest person in the world

['Jillian Harding'],,"Amazon's stock price jumped more than $25 early Thursday, briefly handing CEO Jeff Bezos bragging rights as the richest person in the world, with a fortune topping $90 billion.  The surge came ahead of Amazon's (AMZN) post-market earnings report. Afternoon trading knocked Bezos back to second-richest after Microsoft's (MSFT) Bill Gates. The e-commerce giant's stock slid in after-hours trading when it reported weaker-than-expected earnings, with profit in the second quarter down more than 70 percent from a year ago as the company invested in digital content and its global supply chains. Amazon also lowered guidance for the third quarter.  Having started the year as the world's third-richest human, according to Forbes -- behind Gates and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) CEO Warren Buffett -- the Amazon founder's wealth has shot up along with the company's stock price, which has soared more than 40 percent this year. It now trades at more than a thousand dollars per share, a status only four other publicly listed U.S. companies carry.  Amazon's stature among investors reflects its growing importance in the retail world, where it accounts for roughly a third of all e-commerce transactions, and its ambitions to push into other sectors of the economy, like the food business.  Bezos, who started Amazon as a way to sell books online, built the company into a massive internet retail empire, forcing traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to completely rethink their sales strategies and, in some cases, shut their doors. The company's recent push into video content through its Prime subscription service has thrown down a gauntlet to competitors Netflix and Hulu.  Amazon is notable for relentlessly focusing on growth and expansion, not turning a profit for years. If the recent acquisition of grocer Whole Foods for $13.7 billion, partnership with sports giant Nike and rumors Amazon is looking to break into the health care market are any indication, Bezos is looking to make Amazon even bigger -- and manage a firmer hold on his new title.",Jeff Bezos briefly takes world's richest title

['Matt Egan'],,"Just over two decades ago, Jeff Bezos started selling books online from his garage. Today, the Amazon CEO surpassed Bill Gates as the richest person on Earth, for a few hours at least.  Bezos's net worth topped $90 billion on Thursday morning, allowing the Amazon founder and CEO to dethrone Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft (MSFT), as the richest man in the world, according to Forbes and Bloomberg.  However, an afternoon dip in Amazon's stock price caused Bezos to slip back behind Gates, who has been No. 1 since 2013 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Bezos finished the day worth $88.8 billion, just behind the $89.8 billion for Gates.  What's a billion dollars between the world's richest guys anyway?  Bezos has been hailed as the smartest guy in business for turning a bookselling platform into a disruptive force that has flipped traditional retail on its head.  His world's-richest-man milestone was made possible because of Amazon (AMZN)'s surging stock price. The e-commerce juggernaut's market value surpassed $500 billion this week for the first time ever.  The vast majority of the Bezos fortune is tied up in Amazon stock, of which the CEO owns nearly 17%. That stake alone is worth $83 billion, meaning Bezos could just as quickly lose his new title as the world's richest man should Amazon's stock decline, or Microsoft's value rise.  In recent years, Bezos's fortune has whizzed past that of legendary investor Warren Buffett, Spanish retail magnate Amancio Ortega and Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim. Bezos added more than $24 billion in net worth since January 2017, according to Bloomberg.  Related: Jeff Bezos is the smartest guy in business  Bezos founded Amazon in the mid-1990s from a garage, originally as an online bookseller. But over the years Bezos has deftly steered Amazon into hardware, cloud services, music and streaming shows. All along the way, Amazon used technology and sheer force to ruthlessly cut prices. Customers in turn have flocked to Amazon, which raked in a stunning $136 billion in sales last year alone.  The Amazon boss's bold vision was on full display again in June when he shocked Wall Street and the business world with a $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods (WFM). The surprise deal instantly made Amazon a major bricks-and-mortar player and sent a wave of fear through traditional grocery stores and food companies.  Bezos has used his fortune to purchase The Washington Post in 2013 and launch his own rocket company, Blue Origin.  Bezos is also thinking more about how to give back to society and even asked his Twitter followers last month for ideas.  ""I'm thinking I want much of my philanthropic activity to be helping people in the here and now -- short term -- at the intersection of urgent need and lasting impact,"" Bezos wrote.  -- CNNMoney's Seth Fiegerman contributed to this report.",Jeff Bezos briefly dethrones Bill Gates as world's richest person
[],,"A surge in Amazon stock on the morning of July 27 has increased CEO Jeff Bezos' net worth by $1.1 billion, officially making him the world's richest person.  Aside from displacing Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates in the top spot, the new distinction could fuel Bezos' interest in furthering human progress through for-profit companies. And those efforts could produce big shifts in how the world's wealthiest think about philanthropy.  ""I think his activities to-date suggest he looks at some of his business investments as opportunities to advance social change,"" Jane Wales, CEO of the Global Philanthropy Forum, told Business Insider.  When Amazon bought Whole Foods on June 18, the move sent the online retailer's stock skyrocketing. It also increased Bezos' net worth by $1.8 billion, to $84.6 billion. At the time that was $5 billion behind Gates. But now Bezos' total net worth of $90.9 has eclipsed that of his fellow Seattleite.  Bezos' plan to make business investments double as forms of social change was evident in his decision to buy The Washington Post in 2013. He quickly turned it into a lean, digital journalism powerhouse - something other large news organizations have struggled to do. Similarly, Amazon's recent purchase of Whole Foods may hint at Bezos' desire to reinvent the food industry's supply chain. (At the very least, he has the opportunity to do so.)  Wales says Bezos' business plays offer a window into how he could cement his status as one of the most influential players in the philanthropy world, independent of the Bezos Family Foundation that's run by his parents. In fact, Bezos may already be looking to take more projects onto his plate. Recently, he tweeted his 274,000 followers asking for ways to generate lasting impact with quick, decisive action.  ""I'm thinking about a philanthropic strategy that is the opposite of how I mostly spend my time - working on the long term,"" Bezos wrote. ""For philanthropy, I find I'm drawn to the opposite end of the spectrum: the right now.""  That approach could encourage more short-term solutions to problems typically thought of as systemic, Wales said, and that could be a good thing. She pointed to the ongoing migrant crisis as one example.  ""That requires action now. Governments are overwhelmed, and policy is not solving it,"" Wales said. ""The Bezos Family Foundation, which is mostly long-term in its thinking, is also giving to the International Rescue Committee, to Save the Children, to CARE - to organizations that address the immediate as well as the long-term.""  Other billionaires, on the other hand, are sticking to big-picture work. Bill and Melinda Gates are trying to end polio once and for all, and Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan are trying to eradicate disease and improve education.  But Bezos is a newbie to the philanthropy world (he isn't involved with his parents' foundation), and people just starting out in the field often take a year or two to get a lay of the land and form a strategy. Judging by his past business moves, Bezos-style philanthropy might involve private investments in startups looking to do social good or acquisitions of other companies.  Not everyone in the philanthropy community is optimistic about Bezos' influence, however.  Larry Brilliant, the acting chairman of the Skoll Global Threats Fund, criticized Bezos' crowdsourcing approach.  ""The denominator of ideas you will get in, the vast majority of ideas which are not good, not viable, will flood this process,"" Brilliant told the New York Times.  And in a recent open letter to Bezos in Forbes, philanthropy adviser Jake Hayman took issue with the notion that focusing on short-term goals can yield lasting impact.  ""It's the business equivalent of looking for 'safe, proven investments' with imminent 10-fold returns,"" Hayman wrote. ""It doesn't happen.""  Bezos is not participating in The Giving Pledge , a pact among 16 billionaires (including Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg) to give away at least half of their fortunes before they die.  But Wales contends that Bezos still has the potential to send a strong signal to wealthy Silicon Valley types that philanthropy matters.  ""He is young, he is in the midst of his career, and he's already seen as bold,"" she said. ""What that tweet says to me is, 'I do not want to ignore today's problems.'""",Jeff Bezos is now the world's richest person - and he could redefine philanthropy

['Robert Frank'],2017-07-27 00:00:00,"Of course, Bezos avoids talking publicly about his wealth. Like most tech tycoons, he insists he's trying to change the world rather than get rich. In his commencement speech at Princeton, Bezos said he had the idea of selling books on the internet while he was working at a New York hedge fund. Torn between his high-paying job and a risky start-up, he chose the start-up.    ""I took the less safe path to follow my passion and I'm proud of that choice,"" he said.    Bezos may not only be the richest man in the world today ‚Äî he might become the richest man ever, at least measured in pure dollars. At his peak Gates was worth $90 billion, marking the largest single fortune ever. With little sign that Amazon's momentum may be slowing, Bezos could well be the first 12-digit man, worth $100 billion one day.  On Thursday, a leading analyst said that Amazon ""could be the first trillion-dollar company"" with its stock doubling to $2,000.    Indeed, Bezos' rise to the top of the rich list shows just how large and fast today's biggest fortunes have become. In the 1980s, Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi was considered the richest man in the world with a net worth of around $4 billion. By 1995, when Gates first became the richest man, he was worth $12.9 billion.    By 2005, Gates was still topping the list at $50 billion.    In 1987, according to Forbes, there were 140 billionaires in the world with a combined net worth of $295 billion. Now, billionaires number 2,043 and have a combined $7.7 trillion. In fact there were more new billionaires in the world in 2016 ‚Äî 233 ‚Äî than the entire population of billionaires in 1987.    Gates has been the richest man for 18 of the past 23 years. The only interlopers were Carlos Slim of Mexico, who was the richest man between 2010 and 2012, and Warren Buffett, who was the richest in 2008.  Indeed, with the exception of Slim and the occasional overseas billionaire, Gates and Buffett have been a duopoly at the top of the rich list. Their close friendship and partnering in philanthropy made them a potent symbol of the philanthropic side of wealth.    Bezos will be a different figurehead. Unlike Gates, he is still actively running and building a business. He is far more press-averse, rarely giving interviews or public addresses. He is hyper-competitive. And he is only moderately ‚Äî some would say barely ‚Äî philanthropic.    But like Gates and Buffett, Bezos is not given to many flashy displays of wealth. He has loads of real estate ‚Äî he bought the most expensive home in Washington, D.C., and owns homes in Beverly Hills, California, and New York along with his spread in Medina, Washington ‚Äî and is one of the nation's largest landowners, with over 300,000 acres.

When asked how his life changed when he became a billionaire he said: ""Personally, it hasn't changed at all. The big difference is that we now have $50 million in the bank, which is huge.""

""So this is an issue that we've been looking at very carefully within the administration and we expect to come out with a position shortly,"" Mnuchin said. ""I am encouraged that Amazon is now charging tax, I believe, on their own sales but not the marketplace.

Mnuchin is referring to e-commerce giant's ""third-party"" marketplace, where other firms sell goods on Amazon's website. This compares to its ""first-party"" business where the internet company sell products directly to customers.    ""Third-party"" sellers represented 50 percent of Amazon's total unit sales in the first-quarter, according to JMP Securities. The internet company charges the outside parties a fee for selling on Amazon's website.

They‚Äôre both investors in a trucking logistics startup that competes with Uber Technologies Inc.  Convoy Inc., a two-year-old Seattle company, makes software that matches nearby and available truckers to a shipping job. Convoy said Tuesday it raised a new round of funding from Bill Gates‚Äôs Cascade Investment and other backers. Gates joins Amazon.com Inc.‚Äôs Bezos, who invested earlier. The latest financing totals $62 million.  The investment won‚Äôt break the bank for Gates or Bezos, whose fortunes are within $3 billion of each other, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. But Convoy has become a hot startup investment among fellow billionaires. Salesforce.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff and KKR & Co. co-CEO Henry Kravis are also shareholders. IAC/InterActiveCorp. Chairman Barry Diller participated in the new round with Gates.  SEE ALSO: The Chipotle corporate sabotage theory returns  Convoy was initially pitched as an ‚ÄúUber for trucking‚Äù and has raised $80 million in total since starting in 2015. But this year, Uber rolled out its own version of on-demand trucking. The service, called Uber Freight, connects truck drivers with long-haul assignments. There are other providers, such as Trucker Path, but Uber‚Äôs financial heft‚Äîhaving raised more than $15 billion since its inception‚Äîmakes it a force. That‚Äôs despite distractions posed by a lawsuit claiming a former Uber executive, who was working on autonomous trucking technology, conspired with the company to steal trade secrets from Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Waymo. Uber denies wrongdoing.  Convoy CEO Dan Lewis said he hopes to take advantage of Uber‚Äôs distractions. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt clear what‚Äôs going to happen with Uber,‚Äù Lewis said. ‚ÄúThe leadership of the company in general is gone.‚Äù  Uber said its two-month-old freight service has been greeted by enthusiasm. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve learned an incredible amount already and are continuing to recruit the top minds in the industry as we ramp up our investment in this technology,‚Äù a spokeswoman wrote in an email.  SEE ALSO: These historic Portuguese palaces can be rented for a regal vacation  Lewis said Convoy is fulfilling thousands of shipments and generating millions in sales a week. He said sales volume is doubling every quarter but declined to provide figures. Consumer giants Unilever and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA have signed on as customers.  Convoy initially required pickups to originate in the Pacific Northwest and has since expanded to several other regions. It plans to use the new funds to go further, with operations in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and the South over the next year. Funds will also go toward software development. Lewis declined to comment on Convoy‚Äôs valuation.  The new funding was led by Y Combinator‚Äôs Continuity Fund. It‚Äôs the first time the Silicon Valley firm has invested in a company that wasn‚Äôt incubated in its startup program. (Willett Advisors, the investment arm for the personal and philanthropic assets of Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, invests in Y Combinator startups.) ‚ÄúThe market opportunity is huge, and trucking is a space that has not had any innovation in two decades,‚Äù said Anu Hariharan, a partner at the Y Combinator venture fund.  The U.S. trucking market is worth about $800 billion, and it's rife with inefficiency. Lewis said trucks are driving without cargo more than 30 percent of the time, often after returning from a drop-off. He positions his company as a way to cut costs and pollution, a proposition that‚Äôs attracted not just marquee investors but also a number of competitors. Some have already become road kill.  The threat of automation is looming over the trucking industry, with predictions that self-driving 18-wheelers will replace the large workforce in the future. Hariharan said software to match trucks with jobs and track progress will be necessary, ‚Äúregardless of who is driving the truck‚Äîman or machine.‚Äù  Trucking, even the software-enabled variety, may seem like an antiquated industry for a tech leader like Gates, but the world‚Äôs richest man often leans toward investments in more traditional industries like rail, trash and tractors.

['Greg Nichols'],,"This year is turning out to be a tipping point for how companies manage e-commerce fulfillment.  Worldwide sales of warehousing and logistics robots hit a respectable $1.9 billion in 2016. By 2021, according to a forecast by research firm Tractica, the market will hit a whopping $22.4 billion.  To better conceptualize the market explosion underway, consider that 40,000 units of warehousing and logistics robots were sold last year. A projected 620,000 units will be sold in 2021.  Why the change? In short: Amazon. If the last couple Prime Days proved anything, it's that a) Jeff Bezos is allowed to declare national holidays, and b) the investment Amazon made in warehouse logistics when it bought Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012 presaged a complete transformation in global commerce.  A conversation about warehouse logistics can bore the pants off your aunts and uncles as you gather around the Prime Day table to enjoy your giant carnival style turkey leg, but keep in mind it's the seemingly mundane innovations that transform how systems work. Take the corrugated box or the advent of standardized shipping containers. Boom. New paradigm for global commerce. (Also keep in mind there's nothing mundane about warehouses run by robots.)  The same thing is happening in fulfillment centers and high-flow warehouses. You'd be hard pressed to find a retailer with any e-commerce aspirations that isn't revamping its operations with an eye toward automation and efficiency. Amazon proved that a fast-paced, customer-driven economy works at scale, and competitors are racing to stay globally competitive in its shadow.  In fact, Bezos all but assured competitors would stay a few years behind Amazon. The 2012 Kiva purchase was as much a defensive play as a move to improve the company's fulfillment operations. Kiva was the leading supplier of warehouse logistics solutions, and huge companies like Staples, Walgreens, and Gap--competitors of the many-tentacled Amazon beast--relied on its technology. Those companies were deprived of crucial functionality in the wake of Amazon's purchase.  Now, at last, several robotics companies are bringing logistics products to market, filling the hole left by Kiva's acquisition and extending the promise of the automated warehouse to even small- and mid-sized retailers.  ""Smaller companies must rethink their business strategies and solutions in order to remain competitive in the Age of Amazon,"" a spokesman for Locus Robotics told me, ""an age where customers demand more and more in terms of products, customization, customer service, and delivery speed.""  Locus is one of those newer entrants that sprang up in the post-Kiva ecosystem, and it's finding a quickly maturing market for its products. Locus clients include Quiet Logistics (which ships over $1 billion in e-commerce orders a year for brands like Zara, Bonobos and Glossier) and DHL Supply Chain.  Fetch, inVia, and Zulily are other examples of companies offering flexible autonomous solutions to retailers and fulfillment centers, part of the new standard in global logistics.  That's why we're finally hitting a critical mass, why 2017 is the year the logistics industry forever transforms commerce.  And why we gather once every year to sing Prime carols to the rhythmic clacking of dozens of Dash buttons.",Bezos move spurs $20B of growth in logistics robotics

[],2017-07-18 00:00:00,"Kubernetes may be the hawtest thing in container orchestration, but Redmonk analyst James Governor has a different label for it: the ""Anyone but Amazon"" club. It's an interesting name for a club that includes, ironically, Amazon, but as AWS continues its march to enterprise IT domination, Kubernetes increasingly looks like a rallying cry for erstwhile enemies to combine against a common foe.  Good luck with that.  Remember OpenStack?  Our industry has a long, unfruitful history of banding together to stop a disparate array of 800-pound gorillas. Remember United Linux? Perhaps not, because that ill-fated attempt to combine against Red Hat never made much of a mark. OpenOffice? That was Sun Microsystems' (and, sadly, almost entirely Sun's) attempt to rally the industry against Microsoft's Office.  More recently the concern is a waxing Amazon Web Services, giving rise to an ""Anyone but Amazon"" club.  The club used to be about OpenStack, but that didn't go far. For years the OpenStack community ripped itself apart over whether or not it should strive for API compatibility with AWS, only to belatedly discover that all the talk of cloud-bursting and such was mostly mirage, and that OpenStack needed to focus on narrower priorities than upending AWS.  Not that OpenStack's only failing was technical, says former Googler (turned Cloud Foundry father and Apcera co-founder) Derek Collison. Collison told me open source used to comfortably commoditize old markets once they were heavily funded and well understood. OpenStack, in like manner, tried to commoditize VMware, but problems emerged as the project spiralled into warring vendor fiefdoms, incapable of aligning on key components because they couldn't agree on what OpenStack even meant.  Would-be enterprise customers, he claims, were never willing to spend money on a mishmash of open-source components. This froze out all but the most committed large enterprises while smaller startups tried to subsist on professional services revenue, then abandoned the market. As such, despite starting with football stadium-sized crowds madly chanting OpenStack's name, very few, Red Hat foremost among them, have been able to turn OpenStack into a saleable product.  In this way, OpenStack's aspirations to boom as a Linux-like community to stand against AWS went out not with a bang, but a whimper.  Round II: Kubernetes  Though Kubernetes is very different from OpenStack, and can happily be used in conjunction with it, Kubernetes, too, owes at least some of its popularity to its ""Anyone but Amazon"" mystique. Kubernetes gives enterprises the tools to run like AWS (or Google) without necessarily running on AWS (or Google). Released by Google as a way to foster an open-source path to the Google Cloud (nicely paved with GCP-compatible APIs), Kubernetes dramatically improves on OpenStack's unsuccessful ""Anyone but AWS"" offer.  Billed by 451 Research analyst Jay Lyman as a way to ""create a consistent developer deployment model across on-premises and hybrid clouds"", Kubernetes loosens AWS's hold on enterprise workloads, without forcing enterprises to choose against AWS.  This is one reason that Red Hat has been so keen on Kubernetes (Red Hat is second only to Google in Kubernetes contributions): built into its OpenShift product, Red Hat can now credibly claim that OpenShift is the ""Red Hat Enterprise Linux"" of the cloud.  As Red Hat's Daniel Riek explains on LinkedIn: ""OpenShift, [built on Kubernetes and] which includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), extends its role as a common application runtime into the new world of orchestrated, multi-container applications and microservices architecture.  ""OpenShift expands RHEL from binary runtime of an individual service up to a higher level of integration and offers a comparable experience with increasingly better capabilities than AWS alone, without the vertical integration and vendor lock-in.""  With such a goal, Kubernetes has seen rising investment from those that have most to lose from AWS. Collison believes such vendor interest will quickly lead to another OpenStack implosion. ""With Kubernetes Google is trying to open source the API ecosystem to drive workloads to its cloud. What happens if that doesn't work as Google wants? What if something else drives workloads to its cloud more effectively? Will Google still care about K8s at that point? Likely no.""  This isn't going to happen, Apprenda executive Chris Gaun told me. ""Google is not going to abandon Kubernetes. It is one of their best sellers."" If smaller companies like Apprenda have been able to cash in on Kubernetes' popularity, Google is ringing the register even more often.  Still, what if, for whatever reason, Google did recuse itself from a strong Kubernetes leadership position? ""Then Kubernetes will become a crazy quilt of competing interests,"" says Collison. ""Each of the big Kubernetes contributors is in it for their own ends, steering it toward their own goals."" Not so, Red Hat senior director of OpenShift product management Joe Fernandes told me: ""Kubernetes is not dependent on one vendor and is not slowing down. Rather, it has a sizeable and thriving community and it is accelerating the pace of container innovation.""  That community now includes Google, Red Hat, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM, Fujitsu, and a host of others. Granted, there are varying levels of love for Kubernetes within this crowd (Microsoft, for example, has tended to invest more heavily in Apache Mesos and Docker), but Kubernetes may well be their best hedge against a rampant AWS.  Killing lock-in, but softly  For enterprise customers, it's also clear why Kubernetes matters. As CoreOS co-founder and CEO Alex Polvi told me, AWS is the mother of all lock-in. Using AWS DynamoDB as an example, Polvi called it ""the most proprietary thing in the history of software"" because there is no open-source alternative and it's completely tied into AWS services, and only runs on AWS. While developers may love the convenience, he noted, ""their only way out is to rewrite their applications.""  Ask AWS about this, and they put a more positive spin on it. Deepak Singh, general manager of AWS Container Services, told me: ""Most requests are for more integration, not less. Most customers want want more convenience, not less."" AWS started building out its Elastic Container Service (ECS) before Kubernetes existed, and continues to offer both the ability to tightly integrate with its homegrown services as well as use external options like Kubernetes.  In fact, Polvi muses, ""I wouldn't be surprised to see AWS release a Kubernetes-as-a-Service"" offering as ""customers are asking for it. Look closely and you'll see AWS in the Kubernetes community already,"" a good sign that AWS takes Kubernetes seriously. ""Amazon doesn't like to waste time on open-source development.""  Still, as one Kubernetes insider told me: ""Offering Kubernetes as a service makes it easier to run things on AWS and also leave AWS,"" which doesn't exactly align with AWS interests. Nor does having an entirely open stack. Though ""the value of software has shifted from the software product itself to the running of it,"" Polvi pointed out, having a cloud software stack fully open and available to all, filled with great technology like Kubernetes, is critical to giving enterprises a way out of ""the mother of all lock-in"".  Voting for convenience  I don't think it will work. Not entirely. Sure, as Red Hat director of OpenShift product strategy Brian Gracely posited to me: ""Hybrid cloud will be the dominant buying model for the next decade"" as enterprises struggle to juggle where they want to go (public cloud) with where they are (data centres all the way down). But a rising percentage of workloads will go to the public cloud, which means they'll mostly find their way to AWS, the clear cloud leader yet again (and by a long way) in Gartner's annual Magic Quadrant ranking.  This will continue because, as Singh underlined, convenience is king (or queen) with developers. Kubernetes will absolutely fill a hole in managing containers at scale, but developers' initial lines of code are more likely going to be written on AWS than anywhere else going forward.  This won't stop the Red Hats of the world from selling products like Kubernetes-based OpenShift as a common application layer, and to good effect. Kubernetes in this world becomes ever more relevant and important.  But none of it promises to make the ""Anyone but Amazon"" train a superior experience to the AWS cloud, given its promise of tight integration between its own proprietary services and close collaboration with third-party services on its platform, including Kubernetes. Every good hegemony eventually meets its end, but it's not yet remotely clear what will come along to displace AWS. Kubernetes, far from doing that, will simply give it another way to onboard applications. ¬Æ  Sponsored: Unleash the potential of all-flash storage in your Data Center with Huawei",Why the Kubernetes Kids can't hurt Bezos' Amazon beast

[],,"It is no secret that Amazon Prime Day is a big deal in retail. It may not be a new Valentine‚Äôs Day, but it is certainly yet another non-Amazon retail wrecker of a day. Many investors have tried and tried to figure out which companies can withstand Amazon.com Inc.‚Äôs (NASDAQ: AMZN) e-commerce onslaught. The web giant‚Äôs tentacles are almost everywhere, even in making its own consumer electronics, making its own private label consumer goods, online food ordering, and now Jeff Bezos is getting into organic groceries with the pending acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc. (NASDAQ: WFM).  24/7 Wall St. has tried to consider companies and industries that are likely immune to the endless growth ambitions of Amazon. Some ideas have been promoted by Wall Street and some are original views. In order to qualify, a company has to touch millions of Americans every year. It also has to be implausible that Bezos would ever want to get into an industry or go after a company‚Äôs business segment.  While Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE: BBY) had fought back from being called Amazon‚Äôs showroom, now Amazon is looking to compete against Best Buy‚Äòs Geek Squad. Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST) had withstood the Amazon-ing of its business, but Costco may now be its next target. And Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR) and myriad big brand food companies might have some serious competition for already low margins now that Amazon is going after Whole Foods. Amazon is now even a big risk to the retail auto parts industry.  Again, picking consumer-focused companies immune to the mighty Amazon is no simple feat at this time. Amazon has massive knowledge about consumer behavior, not just from shopping habits but also from collecting cookies and viewing referral and landing pages after its customers leave the Amazon site. And Bezos seems to be awake all hours thinking of new industries that he can wreck. Even Amazon Restaurants has to be considered as disruption to a business model, even if it could actually be viewed as a win for some restaurants.  24/7 Wall St. looked at the consumer-facing companies, again those that serve millions of people per year. With news of Amazon‚Äôs brick-and-mortar stores, there has been talk and real progress over how Amazon could disrupt or enter much more targeted apparel, pet products, pharmacies, consumer goods, consumer staples, and so many other retail and consumer facing businesses. And with an Amazon Prime angle, there are many more aspects that the company can tackle at the expense of great American companies and industries.  To qualify as immune to Amazon, a company had to already have a market value in the multibillion range (all are larger). Each company had to have a fairly wide moat against a competitor deciding to open up next door or down the street, and each company needed to even have a defensible moat against emerging competition that Amazon Web Services might not easily disrupt with a far cheaper business model. Each company also had to have a solid track record and still had to have global room for growth. And finally, each Amazon-immune outfit had to have a Thomson Reuters consensus analyst target price that was higher than the current share price.  American Water Works Co. Inc. (NYSE: AWK) is the largest water utility in the United States, delivering water to over 1,600 communities and about 15 million people. You can have deregulation threats in electricity, but it is hard to get ‚Äúcompeting water utilities‚Äù to households and businesses. Even if you get bottled water delivery, it eventually becomes cheaper to install your own water filters. And Amazon won‚Äôt be delivering your daily shower and multiple daily toilet flushes any time soon. Water has been immune to outside pressures as it is hard to replace that infrastructure even if a municipality opts for alternative water sources. At $77.75 a share, American Water has a 2.1% dividend yield, and its consensus target price is $84.50.  Carnival Corp. (NYSE: CCL) is the top cruise operator in the world. Even if Amazon gets into pricing of travel for referrals, Carnival has the right price points for travelers and it is the largest of them all. It claims to have almost half of the global cruising market share, with annual customers of 11.5 million and more than 225,000 people on any given day. Carnival‚Äôs fleet of about 100 ships has another 19 slated for delivery over the next five years. Carnival investors receive a 2.45% dividend, and with shares trading close to $65, the Wall Street consensus price target is $67.50.",9 American Businesses That Amazon and Jeff Bezos Will Never Target

""To me it is honestly just noise,"" Lippert, whose fund owns shares of Amazon, said on ""Halftime Report.""  The portfolio manager spoke after Trump claimed that Amazon wasn't ""paying internet taxes."" That followed a story by the Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, saying a fake issue of Time magazine with Trump on the cover was hanging in some of the president's golf clubs.  The only way Trump could have an impact is if he changes regulations, Lippert said, but that would have to go through Congress and is unlikely.  Lippert also said Amazon has been benefiting from massive generational shifts, including peoples' changing shopping preferences and computing infrastructure. ""And these are long-term plays that are going to last for the next 15 to 20 years,"" he said.  Regarding technology stocks, Lippert said there is opportunity everywhere. He added, however, he didn't see the tech sector's dip this week as a buying opportunity. Instead, he said the fund usually waits for much larger pullbacks.  ""A small 2 to 3 percent move that we have over a couple of days really has no influence on what we do,"" he said. ""But late last year when we had Donald Trump elected and the market leadership changed, there were 20, 25 percent pullbacks. So, absolutely, we acted.""",Amazon shareholder says Jeff Bezos can rest easy after Trump tweet
"['Lauren Thomas', 'Getty Images']",2017-06-28 00:00:00,"Aside from attacking the Washington-based publication directly, Trump harshly criticized Amazon during his campaign, saying the e-commerce giant operated a monopoly with an unfair tax shelter that's somehow propped up by Bezos' ownership of the Post.  During one campaign rally in February 2016, Trump told the crowd: ""If I become president, oh [does Amazon] have problems. They're going to have such problems."" He added that Bezos only bought the Post to have ""political influence.""  Trump is now calling out Amazon for avoiding so-called internet taxes, what was once a much larger and controversial issue for the e-retailer.  A representative from Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  However, as pressure built in individual state houses, Congress and courts to allow states to require retailers to collect the tax on out-of-state sales and pass it on to state governments, Amazon has accelerated changes in its tax policy.  Starting April 1 this year, Amazon began collecting sales tax nationwide, calming much of the prior controversy. So it remains unclear what Trump was referencing when he accused Amazon on Wednesday morning of not paying ""internet taxes.""  In general, online retailers fall under two different tax systems today ‚Äî retailers located out of state pay no sales tax, while those with some type of link to the state must pay it. Amazon having distribution centers in certain states, but not others, had put the company in a tricky spot.  ""This is a personal thing. ...

But Munster added that Amazon shouldn't be impacted by this in the slightest way. ""Bezos is just going to double down ... [he] doesn't have anything to worry about.""  Everyone knew the increase in sales taxes was coming, for example, so this shouldn't impact unit growth for Amazon at all, Munster said.  Meanwhile, Bezos hasn't been shy about his anti-Trump views either. At one point during the election, Bezos tweeted that he'd save a seat for Trump on his Blue Origin spacecraft, with the hashtag ""sendDonaldtospace."" At another time, he called out Trump's attempts to intimidate the press.  Just last week, Bezos, among other tech CEOs, attended a meeting with the president in the White House, where executives discussed key issues impacting Silicon Valley, like tax reform.

On Wednesday morning, Trump sat down with various White House administrators and elected officials to figure out if Bezos' ownership of the Washington Post and his position as chief executive of Amazon constituted a conflict of interest, as well as whether Amazon should be subject of greater regulatory scrutiny as its dominance continues to grow in the U.S. retail industry.

Yes, the paper is owned by Bezos, who is CEO of Amazon. Amazon Prime offers a discount on the paper's subscriptions, but they operate as entirely separate entities.  Not that Trump cares. The president has continued his attacks on the media with almost daily tweets and comments, particularly when a publication publishes a story that isn't quite as positive as the work found in fake Times magazine.  Wednesday's attack, however, took a step further. Trump clearly has no problem going after Amazon when he feels wronged by the Post. He's targeting Bezos as a pressure point here, assuming that by threatening some sort of ""internet tax"" that he can get the paper to back off.  If anything, he's inviting the paper to pile on.

[],,"HUNTSVILLE, Ala. ‚Äî Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' private spaceflight company is planning to build a powerful new rocket engine in Alabama, the company and state officials announced Monday.  Blue Origin President Robert Meyerson said his company is seeking a production contract with United Launch Alliance, a private company that provides satellite launches for the U.S. government and others. He said the company will locate a production factory for the BE-4 rocket engine in Huntsville upon a contract being signed. According to the company's website, the powerful BE-4 engine is designed to end dependence on Russian-built engines for launching payloads into space.  ""Alabama is a proven leader in aerospace manufacturing with the highest-skilled workforce, business climate and leadership that we need to produce low-cost rocket engines that we need to protect the nation, (and) explore the universe,"" Meyerson said at a news conference in Huntsville.  Blue Origin is considered a leading contender for the contract after it and ULA entered into a partnership last year with the U.S. Air Force to develop a new rocket propulsion system to power Vulcan, ULA's new rocket designed to carry heavy payloads into space.  A spokeswoman for ULA declined by email to discuss the status of the project, saying it is an ongoing procurement.  In making the announcement, Blue Origin said it would invest $200 million in the Huntsville facility and expects to employ up to 350 people producing as many as 30 engines a year.  ""Blue Origin, welcome to Alabama,"" Gov. Kay Ivey said in an announcement Monday. ""We thank you for investing in our people.""  The Alabama Development office said in a release that the state offered an incentive package of more than $50 million, including a $30 million tax credit for investment and up to $10 million in reimbursements for eligible capital costs.  Ivey said the project would build on the historic role that Huntsville and Alabama have played in the development of the American space program.  The BE-4 is fueled by liquid oxygen and liquefied natural gas to produce 550,000 pounds (250,000 kilograms) of thrust and is intended to be used in both government and commercial missions. The engine is designed for both the Vulcan rocket being developed by ULA and Blue Origin's New Glenn orbital rocket and capsule, which is under development.  One political leader praised the project as a way to give space flight in the U.S. independence from Russian-made rocket engines.

['Jon Russell'],2017-06-26 09:38:02+00:00,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has pledged to continue to invest in India as it bids to keep pace with rivals in the country that have landed large investments from big name backers.  SoftBank and Alibaba have pumped close to $2 billion into Paytm lately while India‚Äôs original online retailer, Flipkart, won the backing of prestigious trio Microsoft, eBay and China‚Äôs Tencent via a recent $1.4 billion investment. Despite those developments, the Amazon supremo is undeterred on project India for Amazon.  Bezos went public with his continued commitment to the country in a tweet that followed a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington.  Terrific meeting with @narendramodi. Always impressed, energized by optimism and invention in India. Excited to keep investing and growing. https://t.co/xhQ58dik3y ‚Äî Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) June 25, 2017  The prize on offer is a slice of one of the world‚Äôs fastest growing internet markets. India‚Äôs online population is tipped to reach 450 million-465 million people by June 2017, according to a report co-authored by the Internet and Mobile Association of India, thereby widening the audience of e-commerce customers. China and the U.S. currently dominate global e-commerce spending, but the value of online sales in India is predicted to rise to $48 billion by 2020, analyst firm Forrester has forecast.  Exact data on who is leading the market right now is both hard to come by and difficult to trust, but Amazon is widely thought to have gained ground on India‚Äôs local e-commerce players since it landed in the country four years ago. Last summer, Bezos pledged to invest $3 billion to grow the Amazon India business, having put an initial $2 billion into it back in 2014, and there could yet be more money soon.  Speaking back in April, when he claimed his firm had become India‚Äôs top e-commerce player, Bezos hinted that more capital would be supplied to develop the Indian business. This tweet is another indicator that it could come soon.  There are certainly plenty of signs that Amazon is in the mood to invest in areas where it can grow.  Aside from the recent bid to buy Whole Foods in the U.S. for a cool $13.7 billion, Amazon has expanded to the Middle East via a deal to buy Souq.com ‚Äî which sources peg at around $650 million ‚Äî and made plans to move into Australia. It also laid the groundwork to bring its service to Southeast Asia, although that plan has been postponed to later this year.  In India itself, Amazon has gone beyond the basics, too. It introduced its Prime service last year, although that initially launched without the video service component. That was soon rectified the following December, when Prime Video went global and expanded its reach to over 200 countries.",Jeff Bezos says Amazon will ‚Äòkeep investing‚Äô in India as rivals raise new war chests
[],,"When Amazon bought Whole Foods on June 18, the move sent the online retailer's stock skyrocketing. It also increased the net worth of its CEO, Jeff Bezos, by $1.8 billion.  That put Bezos' net worth of $84.6 billion $5 billion behind - and within striking distance of - Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, whose net worth of $89.4 billion currently makes him the world's richest person.  If that happens, Bezos' interest in furthering human progress through for-profit companies could shift how the world's wealthiest think about philanthropy.  ""I think his activities to-date suggest he looks at some of his business investments as opportunities to advance social change,"" Jane Wales, CEO of the Global Philanthropy old Business Insider.  That was the case with The Washington Post, which Bezos bought in 2013 and quickly flipped into a lean, digital journalism powerhouse - something other large news organizations have struggled with doing. And it's the case with Amazon, whose recent purchase of Whole Foods may hint at Bezos' desire, or at least opportunity, to reinvent the food industry's supply chain.  Wales says these business plays offer a window into how Bezos, independent of the Bezos Family Foundation run by his parents, could cement his status as one of the most influential players in the philanthropy world. In fact, Bezos may already be looking to take more projects onto his plate. Recently, he tweeted his 274,000 followers asking for ways to generate lasting impact with quick, decisive action.  ""I'm thinking about a philanthropic strategy that is the opposite of how I mostly spend my time - working on the long term,"" Bezos wrote. ""For philanthropy, I find I'm drawn to the opposite end of the spectrum: the right now.""  Wales said Bezos' stature could encourage others to find shorter-term solutions to problems typically thought of as systemic. She pointed to the ongoing migrant crisis as one example.  ""That requires action now. Governments are overwhelmed, and policy is not solving it,"" Wales said. ""The Bezos Family Foundation, which is mostly long-term in its thinking, is also giving to the International Rescue Committee, to Save the Children, to CARE - to organizations that address the immediate as well as the long-term.""  Although Bezos' parents have their own foundation, Bezos isn't involved with it. He himself is a newbie to the philanthropy world, Wales said, and when people are just starting out they often dip their toes, taking one to two years to get a lay of the land and form a strategy.  Going by his past business moves, Bezos-style philanthropy might involve private investments in startups looking to do social good or acquisitions of other larger companies, like Amazon did with Whole Foods.  This wouldn't lead other billionaires to do less of their own big-picture work, of course. Bill and Melinda Gates will still try to end polio once and for all, just as Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan will try to eradicate disease and improve education. Wales said Bezos becoming the world's richest person would also have ""no impact"" on The Giving Pledge, a pact among billionaires to give away at least half of their fortunes before they die. To date, 16 people have signed. Bezos is not one of them.  Not everyone in the philanthropy community is as optimistic about Bezos' influence.  ""You can add as many times as you like 'and have lasting impact' but it's an impossible oxymoron to focusing short term,"" philanthropy adviser Jake Hayman recently wrote for Forbes. ""It's the business equivalent of looking for 'safe, proven investments' with imminent 10-fold returns. It doesn't happen.""  Larry Brilliant, the acting chairman of the Skoll Global Threats Fund, criticized Bezos' crowdsourcing approach.  ""The denominator of ideas you will get in, the vast majority of ideas which are not good, not viable, will flood this process,"" Brilliant told the New York Times.  But Wales contends that, like Gates, Bezos will send a strong signal to wealthy Silicon Valley types that philanthropy matters.  ""He is young, he is in the midst of his career, and he's already seen as bold,"" she said. ""What that tweet says to me is, 'I do not want to ignore today's problems.'""",Jeff Bezos might become the world's richest person - and he could redefine philanthropy

Amazon's $13.7 billion deal for Whole Foods has had a ripple effect across sectors. The grocery industry, a $800 billion addressable market in the US according to Goldman Sachs, has a low level of ecommerce penetration. That could be about to change. Traditional grocery store players like Kroger, Costco and Target saw their stocks get battered after the deal was announced.  The effects haven't been contained to the grocery aisles, either. United Natural Foods, the primary distributor for Whole Foods, also took a hit. And the pharmaceutical supply chain took a big hit too.  Then, it emerged that Amazon could enter into a partnership with the world's biggest athletic apparel brand , hitting the likes of Dick's, Under Armour, and Foot Locker.  In short, Amazon is rapidly putting its stamp on industries far and wide. Capable of creating or erasing billions of dollars of market value with even the smallest action, the tech titan has investors and corporate employees alike shaking in their boots.  The rise of Amazon hints at a broader question that looms over executives in traditional consumer-facing industries. If a tech giant can in one fell swoop land a deal and emerge as a key player in an $800 billion industry, what's stopping a new entrant doing the same in my industry?  ""It's been a while since we've seen such an aftershock from an M&A transaction,"" said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, UBS' cohead of M&A in the Americas. ""These ripples seem to be going in much broader sectors.""  Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, combined with reports that the company will start directly selling Nike products, has helped the tech giant add $18 billion in market cap in the past week. In contrast, $31 billion in competitor market cap has been wiped out in the same period.  Add to the two sums together and you have an almost $50 billion gap.  Whole Foods stock has been  Amazon's offer of $42 a share, signaling that investors believe  and drive up the final price for Whole Foods.  Walmart and Costco have been hit the hardest, both losing more than $8 billion in value since the Whole Foods deal was announced on June 16. Meanwhile,  Competitors like Target, Costco, and Kroger have been rumored as potential suitors, and they'd do anything to make this deal harder for Amazon, according to Barclays analyst Karen Short. But according to JPMorgan, Walmart is the only retailer with a legitimate shot of entering the fray.  Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said in a research note that the retail drug space could experience a wave of M&A action as companies try to outflank Amazon.  ""Competition across the supply chain continues to increase as Amazon inches closer to entering drug retail on the heels of the Whole Foods acquisition,"" the analysts said, highlighting CVS and Express Scripts as companies with strong merger opportunities.  Dick's, Under Armour, Foot Locker have dropped about $300 million in market value since Goldman Sachs predicted Amazon would start selling Nike, meanwhile.

They include pleas to support health care, education and loan forgiveness, offbeat appeals to back a leather fetish museum in Chicago, plus snarky demands to reboot favourite TV shows. Even Madonna chimed in, inviting the world‚Äôs second-richest man to visit Detroit to engage with charities there.  The unusually public approach bears the stamp of Silicon Valley disruption, and it‚Äôs turning heads in a realm that usually enlists consultants and experts to parcel out big-dollar gifts.

Facebook‚Äôs Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, who pledged to give away 99 per cent of their $63 billion stake in the social network, are channelling their efforts with a limited liability company. That gives the couple more flexibility than a traditional foundation; for example, they don‚Äôt have to give to charity every year and can make investments and political donations. Sean Parker, who has a $3 billion net worth, is using a cancer research institute he funded to the tune of $250 million to overturn traditional research practices.  ‚ÄúThe world is full of pretty stodgy foundations that generally do pretty safe things,‚Äù Parker said in a December interview.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather see what happens when you do something totally different that‚Äôs never been tried.‚Äù  Even if Bezos is able to outsource idea generation he will likely need at least some apparatus to make a meaningful impact. Demands on his time already include Amazon, his ownership of the Washington Post, and his funding of space exploration company Blue Origin.  Crowd-sourcing  One earlier attempt at crowd-sourcing - via the more traditional venue of a newspaper - made a smaller splash and still required a lot of work. In 2011, billionaire Bill Conway, a co-founder of the Carlyle Group, told a columnist he wanted advice on how to donate at least $1 billion. The response, about 700 emails after a week, required four people to vet. Bezos already has 60 times more to consider.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt imagine he wants to be physically writing cheques all day,‚Äù said Emmett Carson, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which manages $8.2 billion in assets and helps philanthropists distribute grants.  Even if Bezos ramps up quickly he‚Äôll have a ways to go to catch up with tech titans before him.  Bill and Melinda Gates have given more than $30 billion of stock and cash since 1994, valued at the time of gift, according to a review of two decades worth of Gates Foundation tax returns, annual reports and regulatory filings. Gates has probably directed more than 700 million Microsoft shares into his foundation, adjusting for stock splits. Those would be worth about $50 billion today had he held onto them, enough to catapult his fortune to $140 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Buffett‚Äôs charity efforts kicked off in earnest in 2006 and since then he has given about 270 million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares, worth around $24 billion at the time of the donations, to charities led by the Gates Foundation. Those shares are now worth more than $45 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Gates Foundation has given away $36.7 billion and has an endowment of $40.6 billion, Andrew Estrada, a foundation spokesman, said in an email. If Bezos intends to match those kind of numbers it is unlikely he‚Äôll be able to rely solely on crowd-sourcing.  Overwhelming  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an overwhelming task that is innovative now but won‚Äôt sustain itself long-term because of the resources and time involved in filtering ideas,‚Äù said National Philanthropic Trust‚Äôs Heisman. ‚ÄúIn five years his approach will likely have evolved into something very different, just like Amazon has over and over again.‚Äù  Bloomberg","Jeff Bezos moved into philanthropy with a single tweet - followed by 42,000 more"
['Lucinda Shen'],2017-06-19 00:00:00,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos came closer than he has ever been before to becoming the world‚Äôs richest person on Monday.  That comes after shares of Amazon (amzn) pushed up to an all-time high of about $1,017 a share Monday, sending Bezos‚Äô net worth to about $86 billion. That rally was likely induced by the company‚Äôs $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods recently. Before Bezos could claim the top spot, which is currently Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Amazon‚Äôs stock came down toward the end of the day, ending nearly flat at $995 a share. Bezos‚Äô net worth also fell to $85.2 billion.  Still, that all-time high price put Bezos about $4 billion away from overtaking Gates, who is worth about $90 billion as of Monday, according to Bloomberg data. Since Bezos net worth is largely tied to his 78.9 million shares of Amazon, becoming the world‚Äôs richest person is completely within the realm of possibility. After all, his net worth has already shot up by $19.3 billion in the last six months thanks to strong earnings and growing investor confidence in the economy, sending Amazon‚Äôs stock 35% higher since the start of the year.  So how much higher does Amazon‚Äôs stock price need to go for Bezos to become the world‚Äôs richest person?  Assuming the net worth of current top billionaires remains relatively stable, Amazon‚Äôs stock would have to rise to about $1,069 a piece‚Äî7.4% above the stock‚Äôs closing price Monday. Bezos‚Äô net worth would then reach $90.1 billion.  The consensus among Wall Street analysts is that Amazon shares can hit $1,123 in the next 12 months, based on Bloomberg data. But if Amazon manages to show a sizable earnings beat for its next report on July 27, Bezos could become the world‚Äôs richest person even sooner than that.  That said, the company could disappoint investors the way it did during the holiday season last year. It‚Äôs also possible Microsoft‚Äôs growth in the next 12 months could push Bill Gates‚Äô net worth even higher. Plus, an 8% pop in Amazon‚Äôs stock may still seem daunting to shareholders: Despite analysts and investors warning against overvaluing tech stocks, the sector came roaring back Monday, with Alphabet‚Äôs stock up nearly 2% and Apple stock up nearly 3%.  Meanwhile, tax reforms, which are expected to be a boon for tech companies, have hit speed bumps in Washington D.C., as the focus turns toward to President Donald Trump and his interactions with former FBI Director James Comey.",Here's How Soon Amazon Could Make Jeff Bezos the World's Richest Man
"['Jacob Pramuk', 'Adam Jeffery']",2017-06-19 00:00:00,"Despite President Donald Trump's campaign trail animosity toward Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, his administration likely will not seek an antitrust case to block Amazon's deal to buy Whole Foods, according to two antitrust law experts.  But at least one Democratic congressman has cried foul on proposed transaction.  After the $13.7 billion deal was announced Friday, some critics said it would give Amazon an outsize presence in too many pockets of the U.S. economy. But experts said the deal does not seem to run afoul of conventional antitrust concerns: that it eliminates competition or gives Whole Foods too much of a hold on the grocery space.  ""There has to be some kind of injury to competition ... I don't really see an antitrust concern,"" said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania law school and an antitrust scholar.  Any antitrust concerns raised by the deal are ""not likely"" to pose significant enough issues that the government would ""conclude an increase in market power and higher prices to the consumer,"" the ""usual question"" for antitrust, said Eleanor Fox, a professor at the New York University School of Law and an antitrust expert.",Trump likely won't thwart old foe Jeff Bezos' latest move
"['Jeff Cox', 'Shannon Stapleton', 'Adam Jeffery']",2017-06-19 00:00:00,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has changed the way the retail world operates. He may be about to exert a similar level of pressure on the economy and expectations for future price trends at the supermarket.  At a time when central banks are starting to gird against an expected rise in inflation ahead, Bezos' move to acquire Whole Foods looks to be a significant counterweight.  Analysts expect Amazon to rein in the famously high prices of the upscale grocery chain ‚Äî ""Whole Paycheck,"" as it is often called ‚Äî which then could have a ripple effect through the industry.  ""Now Amazon is going to reshape the entire food retailing industry and it is highly deflationary ‚Äî and this is an $800 billion grocery market we're talking about,"" David Rosenberg, senior economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff, said in his daily note Monday.  Rosenberg sees ""a supermarket war of historic proportions"" that will have a significant effect on an industry ""that had already been confronted with escalating competitive pressures from the Web as well as foreign entrants.""  While some economists disagree that the merger's ramifications will be that dire, it certainly raises questions about how truly disruptive Amazon can be. Should the move put pressure on other chains, Wal-Mart and Target in particular, to lower their prices, it's hard to say where it all could end.  If nothing else, it certainly adds a new wrinkle to the policy debate faced by the Fed and Washington lawmakers.  ""We doubt it means much for commodities in the near term, but underscores the changing landscape for how consumers purchase food,"" David Maloni, president of the American Restaurant Association, said in a note. ""Of course, we don't know Jeff Bezos' plans here, but it's highly likely he sees something in food sales that can be disrupted on a massive scale. We live in remarkable times, for sure.""  This particular time is seeing the biggest marriage yet between the retail online and brick-and-mortar models.  Bezos already has broken through the barrier somewhat with pop-up stores and its Seattle bookstore. An active partnership with Whole Foods knocks down that wall completely and already is being touted as a new day for the industry.  However, the immediate implications could be less far-reaching.",Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos may be single-handedly killing inflation

""We also expect much of the associated innovation to originate in other verticals, including financial services, software security, and consumer electronics,"" Coster said.  The rise of e-commerce giant Amazon contributed to the struggles of the brick-and-mortar clothing retailers, and now looks to increase competition with an increasingly challenged grocery industry. Last week, Kroger cut its full-year earnings per share guidance by about 20 cents due partly to higher costs and reported a second-straight quarter of declining sales at established stores.  Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank also downgraded Costco after Amazon announced the deal to acquire Whole Foods on Friday.

The Trump administration will shift its focus to the tech sector this week as part of an ongoing effort to keep its policy ambitions on the front burner.    Over the past two weeks, the administration‚Äôs focus on infrastructure and workforce development were swamped by former FBI director James Comey‚Äôs testimony before the Senate and the battle lines drawn between the White House and the special counsel overseeing a broad investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.      ADVERTISEMENT  On Monday, the Office of American Innovation, a Kushner-led group inside the West Wing, will conduct the first of many brainstorming sessions with about 18 CEOs and two-dozen more business experts. The White House also plans to unveil a new technology council.Trump and Vice President Pence will swing by the working sessions on Monday. Kushner, his wife Ivanka Trump and most of Trump‚Äôs senior aides and advisers will participate.So too will Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.The presence of Cook and Bezos could make for some interesting dynamics.Last year, Trump called for a boycott of Apple products after the company refused to help federal authorities hack an iPhone used by one of the two shooters in the San Bernardino terror attack. Trump also has a running feud with the Bezos-owned Washington Post.Among the other CEOs who will be present: Ajay Banga of MasterCard, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Ginni Rometty of IBM, Brian Krzanich of Intel and Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, who spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention last year.‚ÄúThis is just the beginning of a multiyear process,‚Äù a senior administration official said on a conference call with reporters.‚ÄúThe problems we are looking at in the Office of American Innovation are not quick fixes,‚Äù the official continued. ‚ÄúThese are things that are going to require years to really make significant progress on. Our systems are in some cases 10 to 20 years out of date, so we‚Äôre not going to fix that in one day. But we have to start now. And this day we believe will be a significant one in terms of generating ideas and potential solutions to some of the problems.‚ÄùThe White House has outlined three goals for American Innovation Office‚Äôs IT overhaul.Chief among them is modernizing the government‚Äôs digital capabilities so that citizens can receive federal services that are ‚Äúas good as what they receive in the private sector.‚ÄùA senior administration officials said the average citizen spends 35 hours a year interacting with government agencies, a statistic the White House would like to see reduced dramatically.‚ÄúOur IT systems and the services we provide are years, or in some cases, decades out of date,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúSo our current services are poor and well behind the private sector. We want to improve that and get it to at least a level of the private sector.‚ÄùThe second goal is aimed at finding efficiencies to reduce government spending on IT by $1 trillion over the next 10 years.Those savings would purportedly come from decreasing government IT costs, estimated at $80 billion a year, through better and more efficient infrastructure; by leveraging the full bargaining power of the U.S. government as the world‚Äôs largest buyer of data platforms; and by rooting out fraud and waste through machine learning programs utilized by the major credit card companies.‚ÄúThe trillion dollars is actually a supportable number but it's an opportunity. It's not a solid plan that we have at this stage,‚Äù the official said.The third focus of the group will be cybersecurity and ensuring the government‚Äôs internal data is adequately protected.Several high-profile CEOs ‚Äî including Disney‚Äôs Bob Iger and Tesla‚Äôs Elon Musk ‚Äî left a White House economic council to protest Trump‚Äôs withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.An administration official said that hasn‚Äôt impacted the White House‚Äôs ability to draw major CEOs to its roundtable events. The officials said the demand to participate in Monday‚Äôs events were such that the White House had to turn some away.‚ÄúLook, there are things that [Trump] ran on that they didn't agree with,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúSome of them supported him, some of them didn't support him. But we don't hold that against anyone or favor anyone because of it.  ""This is really about there are different things that need to get done in the country, and even the people who didn't vote for the president, didn't support the president, were against the president, they've been very involved because they want to see the country succeed.

As you can imagine, the vast majority of Bezos' wealth is the result of his roughly 17% stake in Amazon, but he also has several other notable assets. Because of Amazon's excellent stock performance, Bezos is close to overtaking Bill Gates as the world's richest person as I write this.  Bezos' Amazon stock is worth how much?  As of this writing (June 2017), Bezos is worth an estimated $84.3 billion, which puts him nearly at the top of the net-worth rankings, according to Forbes.  Bezos owns 80.9 million shares of Amazon, a 16.9% stake, which makes up the majority of his wealth. Since Amazon's share price has soared in recent years, this stake now represents an enormous sum of money. At its current stock price of approximately $992, this translates to $80.25 billion worth of Amazon stock.  Not only has Amazon's stock been rising at a rapid pace over the past few years, but it also has been rather volatile recently, as you can see from this one-month chart.  To put this in perspective, in mid-May, Bezos' Amazon stock was worth $76.5 billion, and this had climbed to a peak of more than $81.7 billion shortly after the stock price broke through $1,000 for the first time. In other words, Bezos' net worth has fluctuated by $5.2 billion over the past month alone. Since the beginning of 2017, his wealth has grown by more than $20 billion, and it has roughly doubled since the market's last significant dip in February 2016.  My point is that Bezos' net worth has been, and remains, a very fluid situation. If you're reading this even a few days after publication, his actual net worth could differ by billions of dollars from its $84.3 billion level when I wrote this.  To calculate the current value of Bezos' Amazon stake (in billions), multiply 80.9 by the company's current stock price.  Other notable assets Bezos owns  As I mentioned, at the time of this writing, Forbes estimates Bezos' overall net worth to be $84.3 billion. This implies that roughly $4 billion of Bezos' wealth is in assets other than Amazon stock, and includes things like homes, cars, and other possessions.  In addition, it includes Bezos' other business ventures. He began a human spaceflight start-up in 2000 called Blue Origin, which has accelerated its development efforts in recent years. In fact, Bezos revealed that he has been selling about $1 billion of his Amazon stock annually to fund the company, which aims to begin commercial space flights in 2018. It's unclear what value the company currently has, but if successful, it could become an additional driver of his net worth in the future.  Bezos also purchased The Washington Post for $250 million in cash in 2013, and this was done separately from Amazon.  Stock-wise, Bezos was an early investor in Google (now Alphabet), and his $250,000 investment in 1998 would be worth more than $6 billion today. Bezos hasn't revealed how many shares he still owns, but this could account for a major portion of his non-Amazon wealth.  Finally, Bezos' company, Bezos Expeditions has (at least partially) funded many successful ventures, including Airbnb, Twitter, Uber, and more.  The bottom line  Since most of Bezos' more than $80 billion in wealth is in the form of Amazon stock, his precise net worth depends on the company's share price at the time you're reading this. As of this writing, Bezos is less than $5 billion away from overtaking Bill Gates as the richest person in the world, and if Amazon continues its hot streak, that's exactly what could happen in the near future.",Just How Rich Is Jeff Bezos Now?

That inquiry seems to have prompted some thought from the CEO: On Thursday, he tweeted the following statement, announcing his interest in crowdsourcing ideas for his philanthropy:  Advertisement    Better that Bezos spends his money on ‚Äúright now‚Äù philanthropy than no philanthropy at all. But it‚Äôs disappointing that Bezos, the king of long-term thinking, isn‚Äôt more interested in one of the biggest long-term problems there is: climate change. You would think that given his slow and methodical approach to his other endeavors (as creepy and monopolistically intended as they may be), this would be the perfect issue for him to take on‚Äîparticularly if he‚Äôs interested in ‚Äúcontributing to society and civilization.‚Äù After all, as the oft-cited Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change‚Äôs Fifth Assessment Report makes clear, the food shortages and increasingly dangerous weather events expected to occur during the next century will disproportionately affect people who can least afford it.  Climate change seems tailor-made for Bezos, but given his company‚Äôs record on the topic, perhaps it‚Äôs not surprising that he‚Äôs not that interested. Amazon‚Äôs corporate page intimates an interest in addressing climate change, as is basically standard for corporations these days. But the company is not doing so hot in this area. Greenpeace‚Äôs 2017 Click Clean report, a yearly report card that grades major IT companies on their sustainability efforts, gives Amazon a C grade. It received this grade, partly, because 24 percent of its energy comes from natural gas and 30 percent of it comes from coal. (Compare that with Google‚Äôs 14 percent and 15 percent in those same energy categories.) The company also receives an F in energy transparency.  One of Amazon‚Äôs biggest energy consumers is its data centers. These are major but underappreciated consumers of energy: The 2017 Click Clean report reminds us that if the IT sector (made of companies including Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Akamai) was a country, the amount of energy it consumes would be third in the world, behind only the U.S and China. Bezos has personally invested in some renewable energy endeavors, but mostly in ‚Äúmoonshot‚Äù technologies like nuclear fusion and oil grown from algae (a project that has since failed).",Climate Change Would Be the Perfect Target of Jeff Bezos‚Äô Philanthropic Plans

In the nearly 23 years since it was founded by Jeff Bezos, Amazon has acquired more than 70 companies of all shapes and sizes.  An interesting story from 2014 in Dallas' D Magazine profiles Matt Rutledge, who sold his daily-deals e-commerce company Woot to Amazon for $110 million in 2010. In it, Rutledge shares the story of his first meeting with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos after the deal was signed.  Not only does the anecdote reveal that Bezos is lousy at small talk, but it proves something about the way he thinks about business and Amazon's acquisition strategy.  Rutledge flew in from Dallas on a Sunday night to go out to breakfast with Bezos in Seattle on Monday morning. He had signed a contract to stay with Amazon for the next three years and thought the meeting was going to be about Bezos bringing him into his inner ranks.  Instead, the meeting ended up being awkward. Bezos didn't seem to have any real agenda, even though Rutledge had traveled far to meet with him.  Bezos had ordered an exotic meal: Mediterranean octopus prepared with potatoes, bacon, green garlic yogurt, and a poached egg. When Rutledge asked Bezos why he had decided to buy Woot, Bezos paused for ""several painful seconds"" before answering.  ""You're the octopus that I'm having for breakfast,"" Bezos said. ""When I look at the menu, you're the thing I don't understand, the thing I've never had. I must have the breakfast octopus.""  About two years after Woot's acquisition by Amazon and that breakfast meeting, Rutledge left the company before his contract was up. The pressures of operating under and reporting to Amazon had started changing Woot's fundamental style, and Rutledge wanted to get out. Amazon bought Woot because Bezos didn't understand it and thought it was exciting, but instead of embracing Woot's style and learning from it, Amazon made it change.  Cue the chilling line from D Magazine's Tim Rogers: ""Before it can be eaten, generally, the breakfast octopus must be killed.""  Read the rest of the great D Magazine story here.

[],2017-06-15 00:00:00,"Experts on nonprofits and friends of Mr. Bezos say he has been more focused on building Amazon and would probably turn to philanthropy later. The more wealth he creates today, they said, the more he can give away later.  Granted, money has never been Mr. Bezos‚Äô public goal. Like many of today‚Äôs tech tycoons, he has said his mission is changing the world and satisfying customers rather than getting rich. In a commencement speech at Princeton in 2010, he recounted his choice to quit his comfortable job in finance in 1994 to take a risk on selling books online.  ‚ÄúI took the less safe path to follow my passion,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand I‚Äôm proud of that choice.‚Äù  He does enjoy some of the trappings of being a billionaire. Last fall, he bought the most expensive home ever sold in Washington, D.C., when he paid $23 million for the former Textile Museum, which he plans to turn into a single-family residence. Aside from his main residence in Seattle, he has a $24 million home in Beverly Hills, Calif., and a ranch in Texas. He is one of the largest landowners in America, with nearly 300,000 acres.  Yet Mr. Bezos has so far refused the kind of charitable pledges common among billionaires today. The Bezoses‚Äô giving has largely been a family affair, with Mr. Bezos‚Äô role hard to determine. Nonprofit experts said the Bezos Family Foundation, while funded with Amazon stock, is mainly led by Mr. Bezos‚Äô mother. The foundation has given away tens of millions of dollars, mainly to causes related to child brain development and early education.  It‚Äôs typical, of course, for the wealthy to shift to philanthropy later in life. Mr. Gates was accused of not being charitable enough before he became the richest man in 1995, with a fortune of $12.9 billion. By the end of the 1990s, he had given away more than $2 billion through foundations he created that focused on health and technology. Then, in 1999, he ramped up his giving just before stepping down as Microsoft‚Äôs chief executive and setting up the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, with more than $20 billion in funding.  Mr. Bezos and Amazon have stepped up their giving in recent years, after critical coverage in the Seattle press. A 2012 article in The Seattle Times called Amazon a ‚Äúvirtual no-show in hometown philanthropy,‚Äù but since then, the company has given millions to local institutions and causes.","At Last, Jeff Bezos Offers a Hint of His Philanthropic Plans"

['Kevin Billings'],2017-06-10 00:00:00,"Close  Last week has been a bit of a contentious one between the tech industry and the Trump administration. Tim Cook and several other CEOs tried to dissuade Donald Trump from leaving the Paris Agreement, but were not successful.  Despite the difference, several CEOs will be heading to the White House soon for the inaugural American Technology Council meeting, and some surprising names will be attending.  American Technology Council  According to a report from Bloomberg, Tim Cook is going to be one of the 11 CEOs that will be attending the White House meeting on June 19. Other CEOs that will be attending include Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and Oracle's Safra Catz. Several other companies were invited, including Facebook, but haven't responded to the invite and, given Trump's recent decisions, may not attend.  The meeting will be led by Jared Kushner, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, and Council Director Chris Liddell, former CFO of GM and Microsoft. Trump set up the council in May with an executive order in an effort to modernize the government's digital services and information technology. It's also believed that cloud computing will be a point of focus when the council meets for the first time.  Cook vs. Trump  This is surprising, especially from Tim Cook, given the contentious relationship the tech industry has had with the Trump administration. Leaving the Paris Agreement was just the latest rift between the two entities. It first came to a head earlier this year when Trump issued his travel ban on inbound flights from select countries that are predominantly Muslim. In response, Google and several other companies signed an effort to block the ban.  Cook was especially vocal about the Paris Agreement. As mentioned above, Cook was among the several CEOs that reached out to Trump trying to change his mind and stay in the Paris Agreement. Cook was said to have called the White House and spoke with Trump on the matter but obviously wasn't successful. Cook also found himself on the other side when Trump signed orders dismantling environmental protections put in place by Barack Obama.  Cook also took shots at the President during his commencement speech at MIT. Cook brought up Trump's Twitter habits, joking about MIT students hacking in and putting up posts at three in the morning. While made in jest, Cook's tendency to take a position opposite Trump could cause a strain on the working relationship with Trump's administration.

[],,"As Box CEO Aaron Levie prepares his company for the future, he's taking inspiration from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.  If Box is going to stay relevant for years or decades to come, it can't take anything for granted, Levie told Business Insider on Wednesday in an interview following his company's latest quarterly report. It has to try to capitalize on what it sees as its big opportunities, even if that means making investments in things that aren't obvious and won't pay off immediately.  In saying that, Levie was consciously channeling Bezos, who's famously tried to instill in his company that it's ""always Day 1,"" and there is room to experiment and make big bets.  ""That's exactly our mentality,"" Levie says. ""We're starting over right now.""  Box has a good base to build on. The cloud content management service (don't call it a file storage app), reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday afternoon. Its loss narrowed from the year-ago period and, for only its second time, it posted positive free cash flow for a quarter. The company also upped its guidance for the rest of its 2018 fiscal year  All that led Box shares to jump about 4% after the closing bell.  With the company now about two and a half years out from its IPO, Levie is focused on his company's future.  The whole notion of ""work"" is slated for massive upheaval over the next decade, as automation, artificial intelligence, and the slow demise of the PC change the way that offices operate, Levie says. With its focus on intelligently organizing files and making them accessible from any device, Box can benefit from that transformation, he says.  ""The first core principle is that we have to grow fast enough to capture this opportunity,"" says Levie. ""We want to power how the world works together.""  The future  Levie says that Box is making two big bets for the future.  First, it's upping its investment in the Box Platform, which lets developers build Box's storage and file organization into their own apps. By providing developers with a system that lets them store and retrieve files across devices, Box stands to benefit no matter what the next generation of computing looks like, Levie says.  Second, Box is trying to expand internationally as it looks to grow its base of customers.  Customers who are using Box today are better-positioned to take advantage of the wild, AI-powered, cross-device world of tomorrow, thanks to the company's investments, Levie says.  ""We need to build a platform that works with that next decade of work,"" he says.  The challenge Box faces is to balance those next-generation aspirations with the kinds of things that shareholders want to see, Levie says. Box is already taking steps in that direction too. Not only did its overall loss narrow in its most recent quarter, its sales and marketing spend, long a point of contention, was down as well.  While trying to keep a Bezos-like mindset, Levie says that he also wants to be responsible as Box moves forward.

So assuming that Microsoft's share price remains constant or falls, Bezos needed another $3.8 billion to top Gates.

Of course, Gates may soar and Amazon could tumble. And he still has a ways to go.  But given Amazon's seemingly unstoppable march to dominate the web and other markets, Bezos is likely to gain the top spot in the coming weeks or months.

Here we are, 20 years later, and Mr. Bezos has an authentic, legitimate claim on having changed the way we live.  He has changed the way we shop. He has changed the way companies use computers, by moving much of their information and systems to cloud services. He's even changed the way we interact with computers by voice: ""Alexa!""  Along the way, he has bought ‚Äî and fixed ‚Äî The Washington Post, one of the nation's premier journalistic institutions. And through his aerospace company, Blue Origin, he has invested billions of dollars in the race to space, a onetime hobby that, if successful, could change the world much more profoundly than free one-day shipping.

""I've admired Jeff, and I've admired him for a long, long time. But I did not think he was going to succeed on the scale that he has.""  Mr. Buffett added, ""We missed it entirely.""

If you had invested $10,000 at the I.P.O., you'd have nearly $5 million today.  Sometimes praise is due. And he is clearly having a moment.  Perhaps the most surprising thing Mr. Bezos was able to accomplish, despite his detractors, was to find investors willing to trust him enough to invest in Amazon even as it racked up losses after losses.  That's not to say investors were always happy with Mr. Bezos ‚Äî they would frequently punish his stock, making it seem like a volatile investment. Then, every so often, he would surprise investors with profits, as if to suggest, ""Yes, we can make money whenever we want, if we don't want to invest in the future.""  Most executives are worried about the next quarter, but Mr. Bezos is worried about what will happen years from now. That is a competitive advantage that many chief executives could learn from.  ""If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you're competing against a lot of people,"" Mr. Bezos told Wired in 2011. Here, he was expressing the view that some chief executives think in three-year cycles ‚Äî a relatively generous assessment, given that most top executives don't last many more years than that.  ""But,"" he continued, ""if you're willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you're now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that.""  To Mr. Bezos' credit, he was always upfront with his ambitions and long-term approach. ""Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh trade-offs differently than some companies,"" he wrote in his first letter to shareholders in 1997. ""We aren't so bold as to claim that the above is the 'right' investment philosophy, but it's ours, and we would be remiss if we weren't clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.""

He has repeatedly failed ‚Äî remember his ill-fated foray into mobile phones? ‚Äî but he has succeeded enough to outweigh his failures. And along the way, he is likely to fail again, something he says he embraces.  Is Mr. Bezos an easy boss? Hardly. He is unbelievably demanding. But it is difficult to believe that the creative new products Amazon has incubated and introduced could have been born if he were a professional soul-crusher.  As an author, I'm supposed to hate Mr. Bezos. After all, he has pressured publishers, cut their margins and practically put old-school bookstores out of business.

['Kevin Kelleher'],2017-05-15 23:44:57+00:00,"Where were you 20 years ago today? If you were Jeff Bezos or a shareholder with enough foresight and confidence to invest in his startup, you were probably celebrating Amazon‚Äôs IPO, which raised $54 million ‚Äî which in turn helped build a $465 billion company.  Let‚Äôs not dwell on the buzzkilling numbers of how much money everyone missed out on by not buying Amazon at $18 a share on May 15, 1997. (If you must know, here‚Äôs the IPO‚Äôs investment banker doing the math). There are two other notable things about this anniversary: how absurd the debate that occurred around Amazon‚Äôs IPO valuation looks now, and how similar it is to the debate that is still taking place today.  Amazon initially planned to sell its shares for $13 apiece. Some analysts balked at that price because it valued the company at 20 times sales ‚Äî Amazon had made less than $16 million in 1996 and had 180,000 customers. There weren‚Äôt a lot of internet startups to compare valuations to, so Wall Street opted for brick-and-mortar retailers, which traded around 1 times revenue.  At such a high valuation, some predicted Amazon would have trouble selling its shares to investors. After all, its prospectus warned that ‚Äúthe rate at which such losses will be incurred will increase significantly from current levels, and its recent revenue growth rates are not sustainable and will decrease in the future.‚Äù  Instead of bowing to skeptics, Bezos is said to have spent hours on the phone talking the offering price up to $17 a share. When investment bankers argued the IPO could fail if priced too high, Bezos shot back, ‚ÄúCan you guarantee for me that it will fail at $17?‚Äù When the answer was no, he asked the same question about $18 a share.  Amazon shares priced at $18 a share and rose 30 percent on their first day of trading. (Factoring in three stock splits in the late 1990s, Amazon‚Äôs offering price was $1.50 in today‚Äôs terms. The stock closed today at $957.57.) By the end of 1997, the company had 1.5 million customers and revenue of $148 million.  There were still plenty of skeptics. ‚ÄúSome people smoke internet inhalant and their judgment gets bizarre,‚Äù said an analyst at Forrester Research about Amazon‚Äôs IPO. The debate raged, growing louder during the wake of the dot-com bust, but quieting in more recent years as Amazon dominated first ecommerce and eventually cloud computing.  In that time, Wall Street has come to accept that Bezos‚Äô plan ‚Äî shovel today‚Äôs potential profits into future revenue growth ‚Äî could work for Amazon, even if multiple startups since then have tried that same trick and largely failed. Bezos spelled that plan out clearly in his 1997 letter to shareholders, a letter he reprints every single year to underscore Amazon‚Äôs early and long-term vision.  We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position. The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on invested capital. Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an enduring franchise.  What read in 1997 like boilerplate language for an internet startup‚Äôs annual report looks, with the hindsight of 20 years, more like a bold business plan. It‚Äôs one that Amazon has fiercely and faithfully executed. The success of the plan can be seen in the growth of its revenue and valuation. Even now, Amazon‚Äôs stock is trading at 196 times its 2016 earnings. That may still raise some eyebrows, but it‚Äôs harder to find skeptics who would be willing to bet a lot of money against the company‚Äôs growth.",Amazon is still executing Bezos‚Äôs 1997 plan

Bezos wanted to go even higher so the company could raise more cash to invest in customer service and marketing.  John Doerr, the longtime venture capitalist, was the second-biggest shareholder behind Bezos, thanks to an $8 million investment from his firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1995.  Doerr, who was an Amazon board member until 2010, recalls how Bezos had to push his lead underwriter Frank Quattrone to keep upping the price.

""I remember Jeff asking Quattrone -- `Frank, what would happen if instead of $16 it was $17?'""  Amazon management, its board and the bankers were together on the critical call.

['Arjun Kharpal'],2017-05-08 00:00:00,"Artificial intelligence development has seen an ""amazing renaissance"" and is beginning to solve problems that were once seen as science fiction, according to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.  Machine learning, machine vision, and natural language processing are all strands of AI that are being developed by technology giants such as Amazon, Alphabet's Google and Facebook for various uses. For example, Amazon's voice assistant Alexa, which is in its Echo speaker, relies on natural language processing ‚Äì the ability for computers to understand human speech.  These AI developments were praised by the Amazon founder.  ""It is a renaissance, it is a golden age,"" Bezos told an audience at the Internet Association's annual gala last week.  ""We are now solving problems with machine learning and artificial intelligence that were ‚Ä¶ in the realm of science fiction for the last several decades. And natural language understanding, machine vision problems, it really is an amazing renaissance.""  Bezos called AI an ""enabling layer"" that will ""improve every business.""  At Amazon, Bezos said that ""cool"" developments like Alexa and its Prime Air delivery drones use ""tremendous amounts"" of AI. But machine learning is being deployed across the company.  ""I would say, a lot of the value that we're getting from machine learning is actually happening kind of beneath the surface. It is things like improved search results, improved product recommendations for customers, improved forecasting for inventory management, and literally hundreds of other things beneath the surface,"" Bezos said.  The Amazon CEO also said that the company is making AI techniques available to enterprise customers through its cloud division, Amazon Web Services.  Bezos is the latest tech chief executive to address the topic of AI. He did not go into some of the dangers of the technology as many of his counterparts have.

['Will Ashworth'],2017-05-05 09:43:41-04:00,"Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA ) CEO Jack Ma‚Äôs wealth increased $4.1 billion in the first four months of 2017 to $37.5 billion putting him 15th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index; thanks to BABA stock, Ma is a very wealthy man.  Source: Shutterstock  Not quite as rich as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) CEO Jeff Bezos, though, who finished April as the world‚Äôs third-wealthiest person at $79.6 billion. Only Mark Zuckerberg has seen a bigger increase so far in 2017.  Many think it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Bezos pushes Bill Gates aside. Hey, I consider Amazon one of the four buy-and-hold tech stocks along with BABA, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ).  Forget FANG. Now, it‚Äôs all about FAAA with BABA stock leading the charge.  Seriously, though. Could Jack Ma become the wealthiest person on the planet? I think he could, but a lot of things have to go right including building a global business, not just a regional one.  I think Jack Ma and his team could vault Alphabet stock to the very top of the market cap charts.  Here‚Äôs why.  Alibaba Stock: Walking on a Cloud  Amazon grew its cloud business 43% to $3.7 billion in Q1 2017. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has operating margins almost 25%; it makes more in a quarter from the cloud than Google does in a year.  The good news for Alibaba, which is still building its cloud business and currently doesn‚Äôt yet make money from it, is that Gartner projects the worldwide market for public cloud services to grow to $383.4 billion by 2020. That‚Äôs $174 billion in additional cloud revenue that doesn‚Äôt exist today.  Sure, Amazon is going to capture a big chunk of that, but BABA certainly has a chance to grab some for itself. Recently, Barron‚Äôs ran a piece by MKM Partners that put a future value (2022) of $70 billion on Alibaba‚Äôs cloud business.  ‚ÄúWe think Alibaba already has the largest pool of computing resources in Asia,‚Äù wrote MKM Partners senior analyst Rob Sanderson. ‚ÄúThe company‚Äôs marketplace businesses not only serve about 500 million users, [but] they are also provisioned for the gigantic spike that occurs on Singles‚Äô Day.‚Äù  That‚Äôs just in China.  If it were able to grab a piece of the public cloud market share outside China, the $70 billion valuation would run higher.  In March, I highlighted some of the reasons why I think BABA stock will benefit from the cloud. Jack Ma and company have set their sights on overtaking Amazon in this increasingly competitive marketplace and while its run rate is barely $1 billion, one-fourteenth the size of Amazon, it‚Äôs coming on.  If, and it‚Äôs a big if, Alibaba were to catch Amazon on a global basis, you can bet BABA stock will not be trading at $115.  Omnichannel Wins  The word omnichannel is a cliche these days, but if you agree with the recent statements of Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE: SPG ) CEO David Simon about the retail industry, I think you get a better idea why Jack Ma is buying brick-and-mortar retailers.  Simon believes that many retailers overspent on e-commerce to the detriment of their physical stores, but now they‚Äôve realized the error of their ways recommitting to a smaller, more vibrant brick-and-mortar footprint. He went on to stress that pure-play e-commerce businesses are not going to survive long-term without some brick-and-mortar presence to enhance the customer experience.  Jack Ma and Jeff Bezos both know this to be true. Why else would both Alibaba and Amazon be investing in physical store locations?  ‚ÄúAlibaba and Amazon have the same two goals. Two billion customers and a reinvention of the retail model and experience,‚Äù¬ù says Michael Zakkour of Tompkins International. ‚ÄúMuch in the same way department stores, chain stores, malls, Big Boxes and ecommerce have reinvented retail in the past, Alibaba is using technology, big data and imagination to connect offline and online so that there is only a unichannel retail experience.‚Äù  The successful integration of big data with big retail equals a big win for Alibaba.  Bottom Line on BABA Stock  I‚Äôm a big fan of Jeff Bezos. His visionary leadership makes him easily one of the top CEOs of the last 100 years. I‚Äôm starting to feel the same about Jack Ma.  ‚ÄúFifteen years ago I gave speeches 200 or 300 times reminding everyone the Internet will impact all industries, but people didn‚Äôt listen because I was a nobody,‚Äù Ma said recently talking about the pain the internet is causing to industries and economies around the world.  I just love the man‚Äôs honesty. If anybody can become the next Jeff Bezos, Jack Ma is it.

['Geof Wheelwright'],2017-05-04 17:01:48-07:00,"NEW ORLEANS ‚Äì The evolution of the space race became very clear this week at the Collision media and technology conference.  That‚Äôs where Seattle-area tech entrepreneur and Moon Express co-founder Naveen Jain squared off on stage with Randy Glein, co-founder of the DJF Growth venture capital firm and an early investor in SpaceX (as well as Tesla and Twitter).  A discussion about the different approaches to getting into space launched into interesting territory when Jain suggested that SpaceX founder Elon Musk and Blue Origin backer Jeff Bezos weren‚Äôt making much of an effort in space.  ‚ÄúI love Elon and I love Jeff, and both are our neighbors at Cape Canaveral, so we are a good neighborhood there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut ‚Äì truth be told ‚Äì they are all underachievers and unambitious people.‚Äù  The debate comes at a particularly interesting moment for all of the companies involved.  This week, SpaceX reached a milestone with the launch of a secret NROL-76 spy satellite and the safe return and landing of the Falcon 9 booster rocket that put the satellite into orbit.  Last week, executives from Blue Origin and several other space companies took the unusual step of urging senators to provide funding of the Federal Aviation Administration that oversees their industry.  Meanwhile, Moon Express and four other teams are aiming to launch robotic missions to the moon in hopes of winning $20 million in the Google Lunar X Prize competition. Their deadline comes at the end of this year. (One of the five teams, SpaceIL, now says it doesn‚Äôt expect to hit that deadline.)  Why underachievers?  The way Jain sees it, Moon Express‚Äô lunar mission will trump anything that Musk or Bezos has done to date.  ‚ÄúThey are all stuck in low Earth orbit so far ‚Äì and we are going to the moon this year,‚Äù Jain said. ‚ÄúWe are the only company in the universe that has permission to leave Earth orbit and land on the moon. So when we talk about underachievers, that‚Äôs where we put Elon and Jeff. But someday, when they can land on the moon, they can come talk to me about it.‚Äù  Truth be told, Moon Express hasn‚Äôt yet put anything in space, let alone on the moon. It‚Äôs relying on Rocket Lab‚Äôs low-cost Electron launch vehicle to send up its lander, but the Electron still has to face flight testing.  DJF‚Äôs Randy Glein joined Jain in criticizing the industry, although he didn‚Äôt name names.  ‚ÄúIt is a travesty that we haven‚Äôt been to the moon in nearly 50 years ‚Äì we‚Äôve done nothing but kind of step backwards, from the moon to the shuttle and the space station and now low Earth orbit,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn some ways, we haven‚Äôt really advanced the ball that far.‚Äù  To the moon ‚Äì and beyond  Moon Express, which was co-founded by Jain in 2010, sees its lunar lander mission as the first stage of a plan that would eventually see the company mining the moon for resources. And for all of Jain‚Äôs trash talk, Musk and Bezos have long-range lunar ambitions as well.  Last month, Blue Origin offered a sneak peek at the Blue Moon Lunar lander it plans to use to make deliveries to the moon‚Äôs surface in the 2020s, if NASA provides its backing. Meanwhile, SpaceX has laid out a plan to send two private citizens on a trip around the moon in 2018.  Mars is also on SpaceX‚Äôs interplanetary roadmap ‚Äì which is something Glein admits he struggled to come to grips with.  ‚ÄúWhen we invested, it was hard for us ‚Äì at least for me personally ‚Äì to really get my arms around the vision of ‚Äòwe‚Äôre going to Mars, we‚Äôre going to colonize Mars,'‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut what that vision did was instill an inspiration in the company and the people there and [serve as] a guidepost for the things they needed to achieve to get there.‚Äù  A new perspective  Glein also said that he thought the space industry was benefiting from the perspective of entrepreneurs who had no background in running space companies or space missions before setting up their companies.  ‚ÄúWe got involved with SpaceX about eight years ago, and with Tesla around the same time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat we saw in the vision that Elon had around those companies, as an example, was that we saw someone who hadn‚Äôt come from those industries, and wasn‚Äôt jaded or tainted by conventional wisdom but was willing to lead the way in bringing new technologies to life in industries that hadn‚Äôt seen fundamental innovation or transformation in decades.‚Äù","Bezos and Musk, underachievers?

['Kerry Flynn'],2017-05-03 23:45:37+00:00,"Jeff Bezos is well on his way to being the richest man alive. The founder of Amazon now reigns over an aerospace company called Blue Origin and he purchased The Washington Post. His empire is mighty.  When Bezos tested a giant mechanical robot suit earlier this month jokes emerged about his super villain aspiration. I, myself, considered whether or not Bezos himself could be a robot, similar to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.  But after listening to Bezos in conversation with Internet Association President and CEO Michael Beckerman at the annual Internet Freedom Awards in Washington D.C. Tuesday night, I'm confident to report back that Bezos has a soul.  I was a little skeptical at first since there were some microphone problems in the beginning that prompted Bezos to break into a villainous laugh. But the mood then became cheery and fun.  Beckerman kicked it off an anecdotal tale about his first Amazon purchase in 2004. It was a book titled How To Write A Screenplay You Can Sell, or something of that nature ‚Äî he couldn't quite remember.  ""I'd buy that from you,"" Bezos quipped about Beckerman's screenplay attempt ‚Äî perhaps a nod to Amazon's foray into original digital content.

You may remember the scathing report from the New York Times on the woes of employees within a ""bruising workplace"" at Amazon. This wasn't a discussion about what it's like for people to work at Amazon ‚Äî but rather for how much of a good time Bezos has as CEO.  ""Amazon is a collection of principles,"" Bezos said. ""It's fun. I dance into work.""  Bezos views Amazon as customer-centric, rather than competitor-centric. Indeed, that's how they got their start and that's how they'll continue to thrive, Bezos said. Not every disruptive company can say that. Just look at Uber, for example.  ""I have friends who lead very competitor-obsessed companies and they can win ... I like the customer obsession,"" Bezos said. ""One of the things that's really fashionable right now is talking about how disruptive your business is.""  .@JeffBezos: Customer obsession is not just listening to them. It's inventing and innovating on their behalf. pic.twitter.com/25usjqx4mE ‚Äî Tony Fontana (@Tony_Fontana) May 3, 2017  Bezos said he focuses on the customers, the so-called Amazon way. ""The thing I worry about the most is that we would lose our way,"" he said.  That sounds very human, Bezos. Nice work. Another moment that left me impressed but a little unconvinced about his humanity was his timeline mapping. While I'm unclear what I'm doing tonight, Bezos is thinking about the next decade.  ""I ask everyone not to think in two- to three-year timeframes. Think in five to seven,"" Bezos said. ""I'm working on a quarter that's happening in 2020. It's not natural for humans. It's a discipline you have to build.""  Bezos isn't always humble, which actually makes him seem even more real. One of the main sources of his personal income, Amazon's revenue, is Amazon Web Services. Some say it became an overnight success.  But Bezos said there's more to it than that. ""I've noticed all overnight successes take about 10 years,"" he said.  And while Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg are quick to blame the media about misreporting or mischaracterizing reports, Bezos said the media has treated Amazon fairly (even with that NYT report). They could be covering Amazon more, however, focusing on its third-party seller model.  Outside of chatting about direct business goals was where Bezos shined the most. Case in point: I learned that night of his childhood and present-day obsession: space.  ""Anyone who goes to space camp is my kind of person,"" Bezos said in response to Beckerman's admission of going to space camp.  ""First of all, I love space.""  Indeed, Bezos operates a space company. It's where he spends most of his riches.  ""I feel like I won the lottery with Amazon, and now I'm investing that lottery money into Blue Origin,"" he said. ""Our vision of Blue Origin is that we have millions of people living in space.""  See, Bezos oozes humility. Space, it appears, is a rich man's hobby, and he knows it. ""The entry into space is so high. You're not going to see two kids in their dorm room building for space,"" he said.  His perfect future would be seeing humans working in space. It's something he hopes can be achieved by the time he reaches 80. He's 53.  ""I would have such a good feeling if I could be an 80-year-old guy thinking there's entrepreneurs in space,"" he said. ""I would love there to be trillions of humans in space ... We have to do it.""",Jeff Bezos is not a robot ‚Äî I saw it with my own two eyes
[],2017-05-02 18:34:09+00:00,"It might happen tomorrow. It could take until the end of the week. Heck, it might even take until the end of the month. But any day now the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will become the world‚Äôs richest person. After yet another powerful set of results, and yet another surge in the company‚Äôs share price, Bezos is a mere $5 billion away from the Microsoft founder Bill Gates and likely to overtake him very soon.  True, on one level, the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs richest man‚Äù is just a statistical footnote, of no great significance. On another, however, the title sets a role model that entrepreneurs and business leaders around the world aspire to.  After all, if making more money than anyone else doesn‚Äôt tell you they are doing something right, it is hard to know what might. So what lessons can we learn from Bezos‚Äôs rise to the top of the pile? That you should think big, innovate furiously, ignore failures, forget about obsessing over profits, and avoid major acquisitions. Those are pretty good guidelines for any business heading into the 2020s.  The rising value of Bezos‚Äôs net worth has been almost as relentless as the hard sell of Amazon Prime memberships over the past few years. His stake in the web giant he founded slightly over two decades ago is now worth US$81 billion. In the past five years, Amazon‚Äôs share price has more than quadrupled, rising from US$220 to more than $US900 as the company powers into new industries and markets. He has already overtaken Warren Buffett and Amancio Ortega, the Spanish founder of Zara owner Inditex, to become the world‚Äôs second richest. It will only take a few more dollars on the share price for him to race past Gates ‚Äî and given the relatively stagnant performance of his Seattle neighbour, that seems just about inevitable.  Although there were times when he was briefly overtaken by Buffett, and also for a few weeks by Ortega, Gates has hung onto that title for a long time. He became the world‚Äôs richest man all the way back in 1995, when it took a mere US$12.9 billion to take that slot. In the past, the title has been held by tycoons such as John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, or indeed, if you want to go back far enough, by Musa I of Mali, the 14th-century African king, who many historians now reckon was the richest person of all time, with a net worth of US$400 billion in today‚Äôs money. After 22 years, however, the baton appears about to pass onto a new man. So what are the lessons that every business ‚Äî and investor for that matter ‚Äî can learn from Bezos? Here are five of the most important.    One, think big. Amazon was started in 1994 as an online books retailer. But books were only chosen because Bezos could see they were a relatively easy way into online retailing. They come in standard sizes, you don‚Äôt need to try them on, they fit easily into parcels, and there was plenty of space to compete on choice and price. But its ambitions always went way beyond that. As it moved into CDs, DVDs, and then just about everything, it became clear that Bezos wanted Amazon to be the biggest retailer in the world. He was thinking big right from the beginning ‚Äî and working out the best starting place to get to his ultimate destination.  Secondly, keep innovating. Amazon is now far more than just an online retailer. It has built a massive cloud computing business that serves some of the biggest web companies in the world. It is making films and TV series for its Prime streaming service. It has developed publishing, physical shops, grocery sales, own-label products, and drone delivery systems. It is rare that more than a few weeks go by without Amazon trialing something or other ‚Äî right now it is making a huge push with its Alexa voice-activated assistant. Whatever it does, it invariably brings something new to it ‚Äî for example, shops with no check-out staff. Most companies come up with one or two good ideas ‚Äî Google‚Äôs parent Alphabet has created both the search engine and the Android operating system ‚Äî but Amazon comes up with dozens of them. That is hard to emulate ‚Äî but it is an incredibly powerful model if you can get it right.    Thirdly, don‚Äôt fret about failure. As you might expect for a company that is always trying out new stuff, Amazon also has plenty of flops. Its smart phone was a complete turkey ‚Äî it cost US$170 million in investment, but has made no progress so far. Its web payment service went nowhere, and so did Amazon Destinations, its travel unit. Askville, its questions and answers service, was shut down after several years of investment, and Amazon Local was no match for competitors such as Groupon. But so what? Bezos accepts that if you don‚Äôt try out lots of stuff, you won‚Äôt ever have more than one or two businesses. He just moves on to the next one.  Next, profits matter much less than market share. Amazon appears to hardly care whether it makes any money. It is interested in moving into new markets, and dominating the ones where it has already established itself. Profits will take care of themselves. It is not quite as relentlessly unprofitable as it used to be ‚Äî it has actually made money for eight quarters in a row now ‚Äî but its overall margins are wafer-thin given its vast size. Investment in expansion is far more useful than racking up cash in the bank, like Apple, or returning it to shareholders through dividends or stock buy-backs, like just about every other major company. Investors love it ‚Äî and are rewarded via the share price.  Finally, forget acquisitions. It would be wrong to say that Amazon doesn‚Äôt buy companies. It paid US$1.2 billion for the online shoe shop Zappos in 2009 and US$900 million for the video gaming streaming site Twitch in 2014.  There have been a steady stream of agreed takeovers. But they are all small scale stuff given the size of the company. It is clearly determined to take on Netflix in content, but it is spending massive sums on its own programmes rather than bidding for its rival.  Likewise, it‚Äôs trying to compete with Spotify in music, and Sainsbury‚Äôs and Tesco in groceries, rather than taking them out in a bid. Most acquisitions destroy value. It is far better to build your own rival from the ground up.  Amazon is far from perfect. It can ride roughshod over the competition, and it can be difficult place to work. But with its relentless drive to innovate and create new products, there could be many worse role models for entrepreneurs and business leaders.  In his annual letter to shareholders last month, Bezos urged people to ‚Äúexperiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight.‚Äù  That formula won‚Äôt work for everyone. But it is about to make Bezos the richest man in the world ‚Äì and any business could do a lot worse than follow that formula.  The Daily Telegraph","Five of the most important lessons we can learn from Jeff Bezos, the soon-to-be richest person in the world"
[],,"In 2000, with his six-year-old business Amazon.com well on its way to becoming a retail empire, Jeff Bezos quietly launched his childhood dream: a rocket company.  Called Blue Origin, Bezos kept the operation cloaked in secrecy for many years; only the occasional interview, or rare explosion in the deserts of west Texas (where test flights occur), divulged his plans. The company's initial goal was to launch people to the edge of space and back - all while recovering the rocket to dramatically lower the cost of flight.  Yet Blue Origin has since dramatically expanded from a enigmatic startup to an employer of more than 1,000 people, according to the company's LinkedIn profile . (A representative for Blue Origin declined to tell Business Insider how many people the company employs or has employed in the past.)  As it finalizes designs for its suborbital space tourism business, Blue Origin's ambitions grow to low-Earth orbit and beyond. The company has signed deals to ferry payloads into space, is tailoring powerful new rocket engines in support of military satellite launches, and is developing a reusable super-heavy-lift rocket that'd rival those of both NASA and SpaceX.  ""Our vision is millions of people living and working in space,"" Bezos said in an email sent to reporters in September 2016.  As its careers page reveals, Blue Origin is looking to hire nearly 100 people to help fuel those ambitions.  The jobs currently available at Blue Origin  Blue Origin's careers page offers a huge variety of jobs across three locations.  Of the 92 positions open as of May 1, 2017, some 84 are based out of Kent, Washington (the company's headquarters); four are located in Van Horn, Texas (where test launches often occur); and four are in Cape Canaveral, Florida (where Blue Origin plans to launch its giant new rocket system, the New Glenn ).  About 50% of the positions call for engineers, 16% for project or service managers, 13% for technicians, 3% for specialists, and 3% for inspectors.  Most of the jobs are highly technical and come with titles like "" dimensional inspector "" or "" robotic laser operator "" or "" supply chain strategic commodity manager for composites "". As a result, dozens of the positions require multiple degrees or up-close experience working with rocket engines, robots, software, explosive fuels, or other high-tech systems.  Yet some are more familiar-sounding.  For instance, Blue Origin is looking for a staff attorney to help it negotiate rocket-launch contracts.  If you have an eye for young talent, there's also an outreach coordinator gig to work with universities.  And like all big modern companies, Blue Origin has a need for an accounts payable staffer, plus helpdesk technicians (two of them) to troubleshoot software, computer hardware, and other issues with its information technology infrastructure.  Bezos also offers a general application to find people that don't yet fit anywhere.  What it's like to interview at Blue Origin  ""We want to hear from talented people who believe in our mission,"" the posting says. ""If you're passionate about space exploration, feel free to send us your resume and cover letter, even if you don't fit one of our currently open positions.""  If you're thinking of applying and hope to be interviewed at Blue Origin, you may need to steel yourself.  According to a 2016 post by Reddit user tuntini31, it's not unusual for top candidates to be required to give a presentations to multiple vice president-level department leads, then meet individually with those managers (among other one-on-one interviews).

['Rich Smith'],2017-04-23 00:00:00,"""My business model right now ... is I sell about $1 billion of Amazon stock a year and I use it to invest in Blue Origin.""  -- Amazon.com CEO (and Blue Origin founder) Jeff Bezos  Up 46% in 52 weeks, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is one of the best performers on the stock market. That's good news for founder Jeff Bezos, who according to S&P Global Market Intelligence owns 81 million of Amazon's 428 million shares outstanding (about 19%).  Amazon's exponentially expanding stock price recently catapulted Bezos all the way from No. 15 on Forbes' 2015 list of billionaires to No. 3 as of this writing -- leapfrogging Warren Buffett to land just behind Amancio Ortega (Europe's richest man) and Bill Gates (America's own). But Amazon's rocketing share price has had another beneficial effect as well: It's given Bezos the money he needs to build actual rockets.  More money, more aspirations  You've probably heard about Jeff Bezos and his Blue Origin project. In rough parallel with fellow billionaire Elon Musk at SpaceX, Bezos is building a fleet of reusable rockets that could, as soon as 2018, begin launching paying space tourists to the edge of space to take an alien's-eye view of the globe. He's also building even bigger rockets capable of reaching orbital speeds, which could one day vie with Musk's SpaceX to deliver cargo to Earth orbit -- or even to the Moon.  But such aspirations don't come cheap. In fact, Bezos anticipates spending upward of $2.5 billion to complete development of his latest rocket, dubbed New Glenn. To fund this work, Bezos is willing to sell $1 billion worth of Amazon stock per year -- and seems to be saying he'll keep doing these sales every year, for the foreseeable future, until the job is done.  Luckily, he has about $72.2 billion worth of Amazon stock available to do just that.  What $1 billion buys  What will Bezos get for his money? Well, he already has a New Shepard suborbital launch vehicle that has completed five round trips from Earth to the edge of space and back again, without a single failure. (Take that, Elon Musk!)  Bezos also has a new rocket factory under construction in Florida, a gigantic 750,000 square-foot space emporium. There, Bezos plans to build additional New Shepard-class rocketships for tourism, larger New Glenn-class orbital rockets for cargo delivery, and an even bigger New Armstrong rocket (details unknown). Along the way, he may also build a hybrid rocket incorporating a New Shepard-like first stage, topped with a smaller second stage to boost small satellites into orbit.  Additionally, Bezos has confirmed plans to develop a lunar lander, dubbed ""Blue Moon,"" that he hopes to market to NASA as a means of sending supplies needed to build a future Moon base, and of returning lunar mineral and water samples to Earth as well. Bezos says he can have such a craft ready for operation as early as mid-2020 -- if NASA is interested. And since Bezos plans to send the lander to the Moon by way of New Glenn, this would imply that Bezos believes New Glenn itself will be ready for at least unmanned missions by 2020.  What it means for investors  The space race is heating up. It's disheartening to see that most of the ""new-space"" companies making headlines today are privately held, and thus off-limits to stock investors -- but that doesn't mean we can ignore the development.  More companies developing more ways to get to space will necessarily introduce more competition for established space giants like Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA). With that increased competition will come price pressure that will squeeze the profit margins of the incumbent providers -- indeed, it's forcing price cuts and squeezing margins already at Boeing and Lockheed today.  So what do all these developments mean for investors? In the short term, owners of Boeing, Lockheed, and Orbital ATK stock need to keep a close eye on margins at the companies' respective space divisions. And longer term? Just cross your fingers and hope that one day soon the disruptors that are upsetting the incumbents' business model will go public -- and give us a chance to invest in the real winners of this new space race.",How Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Is Funding Blue Origin

It‚Äôs a compelling read, but I would like to push this further. The way I read it, the Amazon founder and CEO encourages others (and certainly his team) to individually and institutionally apply strategic thinking that focuses on how to uniquely deliver more value to your customers, and, in doing so, embrace external trends with a strong bias toward action and a desire to avoid getting weighed down by processes.  That inspires a provocative question: Can large companies be successful with less process and more delegated strategic thinking?  Yuval Atsmon, McKinsey & Co.  It wasn‚Äôt until the late 1970s, more than 50 years after McKinsey started to consult companies to help them improve performance, that the firm established a functional practice focusing on strategy. In launching the new practice, its new leaders undertook an ambitious research to study how leading companies develop their strategy. In a fascinating paper by a previous generation of McKinsey members published in 1978, long before Amazon existed, we suggested such an approach can be highly effective ‚Äî i.e., driving creative strategic thinking without a comprehensive top-down planning regime (which has been adopted by most companies ever since).  To underscore how companies, and not only Amazon, can be successful that way, I slightly simplify, adapt and focus on a few of the findings, which was republished in an article in the year 2000, ‚ÄúThink Strategically.‚Äù  Read: How Amazon will become the first $1 trillion stock  Interestingly, formal strategic planning wasn‚Äôt so common in the 1970s. The authors noted that many companies enjoyed considerable success without advancing beyond the rudimentary levels of strategic development. Annual budgeting was the dominant and often the only formal planning process.  The point wasn‚Äôt that most companies didn‚Äôt have a strategy. Rather, the quality of the strategy of a company without a formal process depended largely on the vigor of its CEO and other top executives. Do they have a good feel for the competition? Did they know their own cost structures? If the answer to such questions was yes, then perhaps there was no advantage to formal strategic planning.  In reality, the authors noted, when companies start to manage a more complex portfolio of activities, the informal approach is unlikely to work at a corporate level.  McKinsey & Co.  Digging deeper, they discovered that successful companies managed to carefully and thoroughly link strategic and operational decision making absent the process but with the prevalence of five management attributes:  . A well-understood conceptual framework that sorts out the interrelated types of strategic issues. The framework is defined by tomorrow‚Äôs strategic issues rather than by today‚Äôs organizational structure. Top management supervises the process and decides the issues it must address and which should be assigned to operating managers.  . Strategic-thinking capabilities that are widespread throughout the company, not limited to the top echelons.  . A process for negotiating trade-offs among competing objectives that involves a comparison of initiatives against each other to ensure scarce resources go where they can create the best returns.  . A performance-review system that focuses the attention of top managers on key problem and opportunity areas without forcing those managers to struggle through an in-depth review of each business unit‚Äôs strategy every year.  . A motivational system and management values that reward and promote the exercise of strategic thinking.  The authors said that fostering and rewarding widespread strategic thinking does not mean that every manager is expected to become a brilliant strategic thinker.  They proposed four rules to what strategic thinking should be (the bold part is unedited, as written nearly 40 years ago):  Strategic thinking seeks hard, fact-based, logical information. Strategists should be uncomfortable with vague concepts like ‚Äúsoft synergy,‚Äù and not accept generalized theories of economic behavior. They should try to understand the underlying specific dynamics relevant for their business in unbiased way.  Strategic thinking questions everyone‚Äôs unquestioned assumptions. Where competitors may see constraints, creative strategic thinkers will seek opportunities. Consider how Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.07% or Southwest Airlines Inc. LUV, +0.99% first found business opportunities where their competitors thought the opportunities weren‚Äôt viable.  Strategic thinking is characterized by an all-pervasive unwillingness to expend resources. A strategist is always looking for opportunities to win at low or, better, no cost.  Strategic thinking is usually indirect and unexpected rather than head-on and predictable.  The authors cite what is often seen as the origins of strategy to illustrate this point with a quote from Basil Henry Liddell Hart about military strategy: ‚ÄúIn strategy, the longest way around is often the shortest way home.‚Äù  No large company can completely avoid bureaucracy or fully trust its middle management to think strategically all, or even most, of the time. Yet it‚Äôs rare and refreshing to see companies of significant size boldly pursue a recipe that was once more common ‚Äî unleashing and harnessing the full scope of its talent to think strategically, on day 1 and ideally every day of the week.

['Billy Duberstein'],2017-04-22 00:00:00,"When Jeff Bezos speaks, investors should listen. Look no further than Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) recent returns as proof he's one of the greatest CEOs of all-time.  AMZN data by YCharts  In his recent shareholder letter, Bezos addresses the topic of staying a ""Day One"" company. In other words, at Amazon, it's always day one of a long journey. There's no day two. Why? Bezos writes:  ""Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death.""  Paranoid much? Maybe, but just because you're paranoid doesn't mean someone isn't trying to kill you. And in capitalism, someone is always trying to kill you (or, at least steal your slice of the pie).  Here are four techniques Bezos gives to stay a Day One company, and my biggest takeaways as both a business observer and Foolish investor.  1. Customer obsession  ""Customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied,"" Bezos writes. By being obsessed with pleasing customers in ways they don't even ask for ‚Äì and thus can't articulate in a survey ‚Äì Amazon is able to come up with revolutionary ideas that the consulting and survey-- based competition can't match.  For instance, no one ever asked for Amazon Prime in a customer survey. It was introduced in 2005, with great skepticism. Still, Bezos kept at it, and Prime hit maintstream in 2014 when members grew 50%. That has kept North American retail sales not only high, but accelerating. Amazon's North American retail segment grew 25% in 2016, a higher rate than the 23% in 2014, and off a much bigger base.  2. Focus on outcomes, not just process  Bezos stresses companies must not get bogged down in process at the expense of outcomes. ""Resist proxies,"" Bezos writes. ""If you're not watchful, the process can become the thing."" While not dismissing beta testing or surveys, Bezos writes great customer experience comes from ""heart, intuition, curiosity, play, guts, taste."" Not exactly something they teach you in finance class.  3. Don't fight the future  While big, disruptive trends are not hard to spot, Bezos writes they can nevertheless be difficult for large organizations to embrace. Amazon is certainly a large organization, at over 341,000 employees.  While Amazon began as a mere book-seller, today artificial intelligence pervades much of the company. Management's nimble nature and willingness to adapt has kept the company at the forefront of major tech trends.  Its Alexa smart assistant has been a massive hit and its Echo hardware has been hard to keep in stock, with some estimating the company sold 7 million units in 2016, more than double the company's original projection.  Not only that, but AI is also improving Amazon's core business with search recommendations, demand forecasting, and other aspects of ""old"" Amazon.  Amazon's rapid embrace of AI gives me confidence that even if we are destined to be enslaved by robot overlords one day, it's likely Amazon will be the company making the best robot oppressors around.  ""Watch this space,"" Bezos writes. ""Much more to come.""  4. Make quick decisions    Bezos talks here about not only making good decisions, but making good decisions quickly. ""Speed matters in business,"" Bezos writes. ""Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you're probably being slow.""  Instead of wearing each other down with exhaustive debates, he often ""disagrees, yet commits,"" to a course forward, and will correct later on.  Takeaways  Beyond the business lessons, there is a great takeaway for investors in these quote from Bezos.  As Amazon's share performance teaches us, one big winner held over the long term can make up for a lot of losers. I can't tell you how many retail and professional investors I've known who have missed out on big gains because they could not get to 100% certainty on a stock, or were too scared to act, even though they were delighted by a company's products or services.  Legendary investor Peter Lynch once wrote, ""there is always something to worry about,"" , and that retail investors familiar with a certain company could actually have advantages over professionals. Do your homework, but don't be afraid follow your instincts and act with 70% certainty. Like the many projects Bezos and team are working on to expand Amazon's empire, not all investments will pan out, but that's why you spread your bets across several opportunities and let the winners create long-term growth.",The Biggest Takeaways from Jeff Bezos' Annual Letter

['Des Luna'],2017-04-14 00:00:00,"Close  Jeff Bezos is a wealthy man, like $76 billion rich. He owns Amazon but still, someone earns more than he does in the company he owns.  Andrew Jassy is the top executive in terms of salary, according to the disclosure made by Amazon. Jassy heads the Amazon Web Services, the most profitable division for the year 2016. Jassy's salary was $179,000 . But the sweet icing on the Amazon cake? $35.4 million in stocks.  The Head Of AWS  According to a report, the chief of AWS became the top earner after his division brought in a record $12.2 billion in profits. Jassy has run AWS since its establishment in 2006. He was promoted to CEO role in 2016, and his leadership of the division led it to its most profitable stage thus far. He is one of the six top-paid executives of Amazon.  Amazon Web Services currently offers a cloud computing service, which gives it a commanding market share of 45 percent. Companies buy the service for their storage power and computing needs via the cloud. Among AWS's notable clients are video streaming company Netflix Inc., and Capital One Corp. AWS, under the leadership of Jassy, also introduced services like speech-to-text service (called Polly), image-recognition program (Rekognition), and tools for conversational apps.  ""Inside AWS, we're excited to lower the costs and barriers to machine learning and AI so organizations of all sizes can take advantage of these advanced techniques,'' Bezos wrote in a letter to shareholders.  Earning His Stocks  Jassy's earnings came from his stock shares in the company. Amazon pays its employees with biennial grants of restricted stock shares that vest for several years regardless of company performance. The same pay model is used by Facebook and Google; the idea behind it is unlike other payment models that connect payouts to goals like yearly stock return or profit, employees can focus on long-term performances.  For Amazon, linking compensation with performance goals ""could cause employees to focus solely on short-term returns at the expense of long-term growth and innovation,'' a scenario that the company avoids.  For its other executives, last year Amazon made Jeffrey Wilke the CEO of the worldwide consumer business. His rewards include a $33 million in compensation package, including restricted shares. Senior VP Jeffrey Blackburn (Business Development) took home $22.2 million, while Senior VP Diego Piacentini (International Consumer Business) got $23.7 million; bulk of earnings came from biennial shares.  Jeff Bezos for his part, could comfortably live with his $81,840 salary and $1.6 million in security. After all, his net worth is $76 billion (as of April 14) and his company, high-earning Amazon, is here to stay.
